<p>Aave allows you to deposit and borrow 16 different types of cryptocurrencies while earning on your deposited collateral. Borrowed assets will accrue an annual interest that needs to be paid back when you’re done with the loan, but this accrual can be switched between a variable or stable rate.</p>

<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave1.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select ‘Dapps’ from the menu on the left or scroll down to our ‘Dapps’ section, then choose ‘Aave’.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave2.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Click the green button that says ‘Deposit’ to see the full list of assets you can deposit. The earning rates for each currency are listed under the ‘APY’ section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different assets have different earning rates and borrowing power. Browse the selection before making your choice. </li>
<li>Remember, you can always swap for the asset you want to deposit using our Swap page. </li>
<li>Your “Aggregated Balance” shows the Total Balance for your deposits. If you’ve deposited more than one type of asset, you will see the total value covered by all your deposited assets.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave3.png" width="80%">

<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave4.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> After you deposit, you will be sent a token in the form of ‘a_Token_’, which will be pegged 1:1 with the asset you’ve deposited. Once you withdraw your deposited assets, extra funds earned through the ‘a_Token_’ will be credited to your account.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, depositing 1 ETH will give you 1 aETH, which will slowly grow in balance as time goes on. When you withdraw, that extra balance will be credited to you.</li>
</ul>

After you’re done, head to the ‘Borrowings’ tab on the Dapp.</p>
<ul>
<li>The “You Borrowed” section refers to the Total Amount you’ve borrowed, including different types of assets. It will also show you how much you have left to borrow, signified by the “__% Available” phrase. </li>
<li>“Your Collateral” shows the total you have deposited for use as collateral. This is similar to the “Aggregated Balance” from your Deposits page.</li>
<li>Note the ‘Loan to value’ percentage at the bottom of this page. This is the amount of borrowing power your deposited assets hold displayed in a weighted average. For example, 1 ETH at 80% Loan to value will allow 0.8 ETH’s worth of assets to be borrowed. </li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave6.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the green button that says ‘Borrow’ to see the full list of assets you can borrow. Each asset has different interest rates that will need to be paid back after you’re done with the loan. </p>
<ul>
<li>You can filter the list between Stablecoins and All using the ticker located at the top-left of the list. </li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave7.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you begin the borrowing process, you will need to choose between a Stable and Variable rate of interest. Choose the rates that work best for you, listed under the ‘Stable APY’ and ‘Variable APY’ categories. Some assets offer both options, while others are tied to just one. </p>
<ul>
<li>If your asset offers both, you can switch between the two rate types whenever you want. </li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave8.png" width="100%">

<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave9.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> You can borrow multiple types of assets, but keep an eye on your Health Factor. This number represents the amount you’ve borrowed in relation to the amount you’ve deposited. If your Health Factor reaches 1 or below, your deposited assets become at risk of being liquidated. </p>
<ul>
<li>To raise your health factor, pay back some of your borrowed assets or deposit more for collateral.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave11.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> When you’re paying back your borrowed assets, you’ll need to pay a little extra to cover any interest accrued during the loan period. All of the assets listed can be swapped from our Swap section through one of our providers. </p>

<p>The Ethereum Name Service, also known as ENS, is a domain service that assigns a user-specific domain tied to your wallet’s account address. </p>
<p>ENS domains take the format of <code>YourDomainHere.eth</code>. The intention behind this is to simplify the normal public address into a form that is easier to use and send to others. There are other use cases as well, but this is the main reason for this service as of right now.</p>
<p>An easy example of this is our MEW donation address:</p>
<p>Normal donation address: <code>0xDECAF9CD2367cdbb726E904cD6397eDFcAe6068D</code></p>
<p>.eth donation address: <code>mewtopia.eth</code></p>
<p>Both of these addresses lead to the same wallet destination, but the ENS domain is much more convenient.</p>

<ul>
<li>Always check the URL to make sure you’re on our legit site!</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ENS1-1.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Access your wallet. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t already have a wallet, you will need to <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet/">create a new wallet</a>. </li>
<li>You will also need a small amount of ETH for <a href="/en/transactions/what-is-gas/">gas</a>. We generally recommend <code>.01 ETH</code> for 1 - 2 transactions. Initializing and finalizing ENS domains both count as a transactions.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ENS1-2.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Head to the Dapps section, to the left of your wallet’s overview page. It can also be found at the bottom of the page, under the ‘Dapps’ section. </p>
<ul>
<li>Here you will see the ‘ENS Manager’ option. Click there!</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ENS1-3.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Enter your desired domain name to see if it is available.</p>
<ul>
<li>ENS domains must be 3 characters or longer.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that the final product will look like <code>YourDomainHere.eth</code>.</li>
<li>You can also search Etherscan.io for available ENS domains.</li>
<li>If it says to migrate the ENS domain to the new registrar, that means it is unavailable (unless it’s already yours, in which case you should migrate it. All migrations must take place by May 4th, 2020.)</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ENS1-4.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> If your domain is available, you can register it. Select the amount of time you wish to own the domain and click <code>Register</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most longer domains cost the equivalent of $5/year in ETH to maintain, but the shorter the domain, the more expensive it becomes.</li>
<li>They can be owned indefinitely, as long as this annual fee is paid. </li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ENS1-5.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> After confirming the transaction, your domain request will process for a moment. When it’s done, select <code>Register</code> again and confirm the second transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you’ve found your domain, click ‘Manage’. </p>

<p>Unstoppable Domains is a service that assigns a user-specific domain tied to your wallet’s account address. </p>
<p>Unstoppable Domains take the format of <code>YourDomainHere.crypto</code>. The intention behind this is to simplify the normal public address into a form that is easier to use and send to others. </p>
<p>An easy example of this is our MEW donation address:</p>
<p>Normal donation address: <code>0xDECAF9CD2367cdbb726E904cD6397eDFcAe6068D</code></p>
<p>.crypto donation address: <code>mewtopia.crypto</code></p>
<p>Both of these addresses lead to the same wallet destination, but the Unstoppable Domain version is much more convenient.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Register-an-Unstoppable-Domain"><a href="#How-to-Register-an-Unstoppable-Domain" class="headerlink" title="How to Register an Unstoppable Domain"></a><strong>How to Register an Unstoppable Domain</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to MyEtherWallet.com.</p>
<ul>
<li>Always check the URL to make sure you’re on our legit site!</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ENS1-1.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Access your wallet. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t already have a wallet, you will need to <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet/">create a new wallet</a>. </li>
<li>You will also need $40 worth of ETH for the domain, and a small amount of ETH for <a href="/en/transactions/what-is-gas/">gas</a>. We generally recommend <code>.01 ETH</code> for 1 - 2 transactions. </li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ENS1-2.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Head to the Dapps section, to the left of your wallet’s overview page. It can also be found at the bottom of the page, under the ‘Dapps’ section. </p>
<ul>
<li>Here you will see the ‘Unstoppable Domains’ option. Click there!</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ud1.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Enter your desired domain name to see if it is available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unstoppable Domains must be 6 characters or longer.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that the final product will look like <code>YourDomainHere.crypto</code>.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ud2.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> If your domain is available, you can buy it for $40 by clicking ‘Buy’. </p>
<ul>
<li>Unstoppable Domains allows you to purchase the domain with fiat through a Credit Card, if you want to. This process is handled by a third party service called Stripe. </li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ud3.png" width="100%">
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ud4.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> After confirming the transaction, your domain request will process for a moment. When it’s done, you will be redirected to a page that tells you to wait around 5 - 10 minutes.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ud5.png" width="100%">
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ud7.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> After the processing is completed, you’re done! Your new domain will be transferred to the wallet you used to purchase it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The address your domain points to should automatically be set as the same one you used to purchase it. </li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ud8.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>This process will set your address as the owner of the domain. To view more information about your domain, you’ll need to set up an account at <a href="https://www.unstoppabledomains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Unstoppable Domains website</a>, or search your new .crypto domain on their homepage.</strong></p>

<p>(<a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/24737/myetherwallet-json-rpc-interface-ratelimiting/25113#25113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a>)</p>
<p>MyEtherWallet, at the time of this writing, rate-limits at 400 requests per minute (or about 6 requests per second). This is in order to prevent DDOS’s like we have seen before, or people using our nodes to excess.</p>
<p>This should be more than enough for a single person’s use, but feel free to reach out to us about why you need more, and we can adjust.</p>
<p>If you are going to be using it more than 400 req per minute on average, or just want to ensure uptime, we strongly recommend you get your own node.</p>
<p>Our backend infrastructure is on AWS and is open-source via Docker + CloudFormation walkthrough. You can actually do it yourself and run your own public or private node via <a href="https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/docker-geth-lb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these instructions</a>. </p>
<p>Or you could pay a small fee and use <a href="https//quicknode.io/">QuikNode</a>, which makes it even easier.</p>
<p>For both of these options, you could connect to your new node via the ‘Add Custom Node’ option in the network selector in the top-right corner. Further details on how to connect to your own node can be found <a href="/en/networks-and-nodes/unable-to-connect-to-custom-node/">here</a>, or you could connect directly via API.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access your wallet and head to the ‘Contracts’ section, to the left of your wallet interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Locate your preferred Multisig Contract ABI in the dropdown, or manually enter the contract’s ABI. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Check the contract address to make sure it’s the one you’re looking for, then press ‘Continue’. </p>
<ul>
<li>You may need to enter your contract address in the ‘Contract Address’ field at the top. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Select ‘Execute’ from the dropdown menu. </p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the address you want to send to in the <code>_To</code> field.</li>
<li>Enter the amount you want to send in the <code>_Value</code> field. </li>
<li>In the <code>Data</code> field, type <code>0x</code>. This sets it to empty. </li>
<li>Leave the <code>Value in ETH</code> as <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Click <code>Write</code>.</li>
<li>Confirm the transaction and send. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Click the Transaction ID that outputs with the ‘Success’ message. Copy this ID.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> If it’s a multisig contract with two owners, you will need to refresh this page and choose ‘Confirm’.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Step 5, you opened the Transaction ID from the ‘Execute’ call. You should have a page like <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0c643a1ae66637217f24791df05071c7849941a1231cf9fa2a0daf145da833e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> open.</li>
<li>Click the ‘Event Logs’ tab.</li>
<li>For reference, at <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47e4cc8748e296d9b5d85ebd9bd705177bb1940517b084a2efcca11feeb2391d#eventlog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> link (note this is not YOUR link, it’s an example), the <code>_h</code> value would be <code>9228aeaf3ed560274899483646ea4ce9b322bccffac60cac2d035d08752617f4</code>.</li>
<li>Check the link above where it says that string, and then compare it to find what YOUR <code>_h</code> value is. It will be different than what we provided as an example. </li>
<li>Go back to MEW, where you have the ‘Confirm’ page open, and paste your string into the <code>_h</code> field.</li>
<li>Click ‘Write’ again.</li>
<li>Confirm and send the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Double-check to confirm everything went as intended.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> If your multisig is a 3 of 5 multisig, you will repeat the confirm process outlined in Step 6 until it reaches the necessary approvals. Luckily, the <code>_h</code> value will remain the same for each of them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> You can view another approval for our previous example <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47e4cc8748e296d9b5d85ebd9bd705177bb1940517b084a2efcca11feeb2391d#eventlog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.</strong> Feel free to repeat this process whenever you want to send ETH. </p>

<p>You can now use MEW as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing access to a faster and more stable version of our site directly from a shortcut on your computer desktop or smartphone. Using a PWA on your computer eliminates the risk of accessing a fake website or a compromised DNS, adding to the security of interacting with crypto services online. </p>
<p>On a smartphone, it enables the use of MEW’s interface as a real app accessible right from your phone’s app directory. This allows our interface to send notifications and be used offline, the same as any traditional smartphone app. </p>
<p>To make use of this feature, you first need to be on a supported browser (Chrome and Brave are MEW-recommended browsers).</p>
<p>Head to our web page and check in your browser settings for the option “Install MyEtherWallet…”</p>
<p>This will install the website to your computer as a PWA shortcut, making it available for easy access and providing an improved user experience.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at what a contract is. A contract generally outlines a relationship between two parties, bound by law. If one party violates that contract, actions can be taken against them for essentially breaking the law. Many beginning users confuse contracts and smart contracts, and while they can hold similar functionality, they are used for different purposes.</p>
<p>A smart contract is a self-executing contract, written in code, the primary purpose of which is to achieve a goal without the interference of a middleman. Smart contracts can be used to exchange money, property, shares, data, or anything of real value, while remaining decentralized and transparent. The contract itself regulates what action is taken, based on its code. Smart contracts will always achieve the same end goal, based on what input is being used. While regular contracts are meant to be permanently (or temporarily) binding to the law, smart contracts actually are permanent. They make their own laws with their behavior. Using a smart contract for any other purpose than their primary one is impossible. They are immutable, bound to the Ethereum blockchain and unable to be edited. This may sound a bit complicated or confusing, so let’s view it in a different light. </p>
<p>The original creator of smart contract technology was Nick Szabo. In 1993, he hatched the idea for a system similar to a digital vending machine. A user could input a value or data string, and the digital machine would execute itself based on the input to return a finite item. This is how smart contracts were developed. A simple example of this would be a user sending ETH to their friend, but only at a specified time. They could create their own smart contract to send the funds at a later date, deposit their funds, and the smart contract would self-execute to send the funds as specified without any further external input. </p>
<p>The Ethereum blockchain was created specifically to write and execute smart contracts. While Bitcoin technically supported the very basic smart contract of transferring BTC, this is generally regarded as only the tip of the iceberg. With a little innovation and creativity, smart contracts can be built on top of one another to create completely decentralized applications (Dapps) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In these cases, each smart contract performs a function, which triggers another function in another contract, which continues to develop until a complicated action is completed without needing any centralized authority to monitor it. </p>
<h2 id="Some-generally-well-known-use-cases-for-smart-contracts-are"><a href="#Some-generally-well-known-use-cases-for-smart-contracts-are" class="headerlink" title="Some generally well-known use cases for smart contracts are:"></a><strong>Some generally well-known use cases for smart contracts are:</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Multi-signature wallets, which require a majority of the wallet’s owners to agree on spending before the contract executes.</li>
<li>Managing relationship agreements between two users, i.e. buying insurance or property ownership.</li>
<li>Providing information or utility for other contracts to pull from.</li>
<li>Storing information, such as personal information, medical data, membership records, consensus ledgers, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>The use cases for smart contracts are endless. We are only beginning to scratch the surface of what this technology can offer, and how it will revolutionize the world. </p>

<p>Your ETH &amp; tokens are on the Ethereum blockchain, regardless of what service you use to access them. When you move them, you are sending them from one address on the blockchain to another. These are lines of code. Your wallet file, hardware wallet, the interface you interact with, or your private key do not have funds in them. These are ways of access, which give you the ability to prove ownership over digital coins that are on the blockchain itself.</p>
<p><strong>If you use a client-side tool like MyEtherWallet or Mist, Metamask, Exodus, or Jaxx,</strong> then you have the private key (or a similar method of access), and you control your funds <em>and</em> your key. You do not rely on Coinbase or Gemini sending your funds from their account to yours.</p>
<p>The upside is that you, and only you, control your keys. An exchange getting hacked won’t affect you. The downside is that you, <strong>and only you,</strong> control your keys. No one else has them, nor can they recover them, should they be lost.</p>
<p>If you do lose your private key or wallet file and password, you cannot prove ownership of an account, and you permanently lose access to your funds.</p>
<p><strong>If you use an exchange like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Polonix, Bittrex,</strong> then you have an account with that company, and they hold your ETH and your keys for you. They have their own account on the blockchain with all their and their customers’ funds in it. Then you have a username / password with them, on their servers, and they keep track of how much ETH they “owe” you.</p>
<p>This allows you to have the more traditional username / password account dynamic and do things like reset your password if you forget it, change your password if your password is compromised, and turn on 2FA. However, it also means that if the exchange loses ETH, it’s your ETH that is lost.</p>
<p><strong>If you choose to move from an exchange to a wallet where you control your keys,</strong> you need to make sure that you have multiple backups, stored in separate locations, of your private key / keystore file / recovery phrase. This will prevent loss in case your computer crashes or your house burns down or anything else.</p>

This means:"></a><strong>You also need to ensure you keep these keys secure. This means:</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Don’t enter it on random websites.</li>
<li>Always ensure you are on the correct site or downloading from the legitimate repo / website.</li>
<li>Don’t email your key, send it to anyone, or post it online.</li>
<li>Don’t save it to cloud storage.</li>
<li>Don’t have Team Viewer or other remote access software on your computer.</li>
<li>And last but not least, <a href="/en/offline/using-mew-offline/">use MEW offline</a>!!</li>
</ul>
<p>If this seems very overwhelming, we recommend purchasing a <a href="https://www.ledger.com/?r=fa4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ledger</a> or <a href="https://shop.trezor.io/?a=myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trezor</a> hardware wallet. These help keep your keys safe and stored in an “offline” device, rather than on your computer. In this case, you don’t have to worry about files or strings of characters; instead you just connect your hardware wallet to your computer.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="Account"><a href="#Account" class="headerlink" title="Account"></a><strong>Account</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A public &amp; private keypair that “holds” your funds.</li>
<li>Your funds are actually stored on the blockchain, not in the wallet or account.</li>
<li>Just like your Reddit account has a username (public) and password (private), so does your Ethereum account. For additional security, you can use a password to encrypt your private key which would result in a username (public) and password (private) and password for that password (private + more secure). Read more about this <a href="/en/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-keystore-file/">here</a>.</li>

<li>You use this to send funds to an account.</li>
<li>Sometimes referred to as the “public key”, which is not accurate (as explained below).</li>
<li>A string made up of 0x + 40 hexadecimal characters (42 total characters).</li>
<li>In Ethereum, the address begins with ‘0x’.</li>
<li>Example: <code>0x06A85356DCb5b307096726FB86A78c59D38e08ee</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Public-Key"><a href="#Public-Key" class="headerlink" title="Public Key"></a><strong>Public Key</strong></h2><ul>
<li>In cryptography, you have a keypair: the public and private key.</li>
<li>You can derive a public key from a private key, but cannot derive a private key from a public key.</li>
<li>In Ethereum, the address “acts” like the public key, but it’s not actually the public key.</li>
<li>(Advanced) In Ethereum, the public key is derived from the private key and is 128 hex characters. You then take the “SHA3” (Keccak-256) hash of this (64 characters), take the last 40 characters, and prefix with 0x, give you your 42-character address.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Private-Key"><a href="#Private-Key" class="headerlink" title="Private Key"></a><strong>Private Key</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The secret half of your Address / public key pairing.</li>
<li>A string of 64 hexadecimal characters.</li>
<li>(Almost) every string of 64 hexadecimal characters is a private key.</li>
<li>If you hand-type a private key differently today than yesterday, you will access a different wallet. </li>
<li><strong>Never hand-type your private key.</strong></li>
<li>This is the key you need to keep safe. Without it you cannot access your funds. Although, you don’t need to save this raw, unencrypted private key in this format. You can save a more secure version of it (i.e. the Keystore File / Mnemonic Phrase).</li>
<li>Example: <code>afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Keystore-File"><a href="#Keystore-File" class="headerlink" title="Keystore File"></a><strong>Keystore File</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Encrypted version of your private key in JSON format (though it does not have a JSON extension).</li>
<li>A fancy version of your private key that is protected by a password of your choosing.</li>
<li>Safer than a private key because you need the password.</li>
<li>File name usually is in the format:<br><code>UTC + -- + DATE_CREATED + -- + YOUR_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_THE_Ox</code></li>
<li>Example of file name:<br><code>UTC--2017-07-02T20-33-09.177Z--06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee</code></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="Mnemonic-Phrase-Recovery-Phrase"><a href="#Mnemonic-Phrase-Recovery-Phrase" class="headerlink" title="Mnemonic Phrase (Recovery Phrase)"></a><strong>Mnemonic Phrase (Recovery Phrase)</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Another fancy version of your private key, that is actually used to derive multiple private keys.</li>
<li>Usually, a 12 or 24 word phrase that allows you to access an infinite number of accounts.</li>
<li>Sometimes includes an extra 13th or 25th word chosen by the user, for added security.</li>
<li>Used by Ledger, Trezor, MEWconnect, MetaMask, Jaxx, and others.</li>
<li>Originates from BIP 39 Spec.</li>
<li>The accounts you can access with this phrase are determined by the <a href="https://medium.com/myetherwallet/hd-wallets-and-derivation-paths-explained-865a643c7bf2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“derivation path”</a>.</li>
<li>Example 12-words:<br><code>brain surround have swap horror body response double fire dumb bring hazard</code></li>
<li>Example 24-words:<br><code>card enrich gesture connect kick topple fan body blind engine lemon swarm venue praise addict agent unaware equal bean sing govern income link leg</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Hardware-Wallet"><a href="#Hardware-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Wallet"></a><strong>Hardware Wallet</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Typically, a device that “holds” your private key(s), ensuring these keys are safe.</li>
<li>They generally use a 24-word phrase. This phrase you should write down on paper (not on your computer) and store separately from your hardware wallet, in multiple locations.</li>
<li>If you lose your hardware wallet, you can still gain access to your accounts &amp; funds via the mnemonic phrase you wrote down.</li>
<li><strong>Never type the recovery phrase on your computer.</strong> It defeats the purpose of your hardware wallet.</li>

<h2 id="Address-Identicon-Address-Icon"><a href="#Address-Identicon-Address-Icon" class="headerlink" title="Address Identicon / Address Icon"></a><strong>Address Identicon / Address Icon</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The colorful blob of colors that corresponds to your address.</li>
<li>It is an easy way to see if your address is correct.</li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/lHUrIiZ.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Example 1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/FvyLewS.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Example 2</a></li>
<li>Note: The above addresses are a single character different but have remarkably different icons &amp; colors. Even one difference in character will result in a completely separate wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Hexadecimal"><a href="#Hexadecimal" class="headerlink" title="Hexadecimal"></a><strong>Hexadecimal</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Used all over Ethereum for a variety of things, a hexadecimal string is comprised of the numbers <code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code> and <code>A B C D E F</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Seed"><a href="#Seed" class="headerlink" title="Seed"></a><strong>Seed</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The input given to derive a private key. </li>
<li>Some use this as another way of saying ‘Recovery Phrase’ or ‘Mnemonic Phrase’.</li>
<li>This should always be generated in a truly random way, not something you make up with your brain.</li>
<li>If you chose the seed, it is known as a brain wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Brain-Wallet"><a href="#Brain-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Brain Wallet"></a><strong>Brain Wallet</strong></h2><ul>
<li>An account generated from a seed / password / passphrase of your choosing.</li>
<li>Humans are not capable of generating enough entropy, so the wallets derived from these phrases are insecure.</li>
<li>Brain wallets can generally be brute-forced easily by super fast computers.</li>
<li><em>Don’t use brain wallets.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Entropy"><a href="#Entropy" class="headerlink" title="Entropy"></a><strong>Entropy</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Also known as “randomness”.</li>
<li>The more random something is, the more entropy it has, and the more secure it is.</li>
<li>Usually defined in “bits of entropy”, or the number of years it would take to brute-force a ____ (i.e. private key) derived with that much entropy.</li>
<li>Ethereum private keys are 256-bit keys</li>
<li>24-Word mnemonic phrases are also 256 bits of entropy. 2048 words in the dictionary. 11 bits of entropy (the words). <code>11 * 24 = 264</code>. The last word is a checksum (read more about checksum <a href="/en/common-issues/not-checksummed/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Derive-Derivation"><a href="#Derive-Derivation" class="headerlink" title="Derive / Derivation"></a><strong>Derive / Derivation</strong></h2><ul>
<li>To derive something is to obtain it from an original source.</li>
<li>For example, if we were to derive a Keystore from a private key and a password, this means that the Keystore is made from these two sources.</li>
<li>The Keystore is a product of the two, thus it is derived from them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Encryption"><a href="#Encryption" class="headerlink" title="Encryption"></a><strong>Encryption</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Encryption is the act of taking a string of letters/numbers, like your private key, and turning them into another string of letters/numbers through a method of private translation.</li>
<li>There are various different encryption methods.</li>
<li>Encryption offers protection against those trying to steal your information!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Encrypted-vs-Unencrypted-Keys"><a href="#Encrypted-vs-Unencrypted-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Encrypted vs Unencrypted Keys"></a><strong>Encrypted vs Unencrypted Keys</strong></h2><ul>
<li>An unencrypted private key is 64 characters long, and it is used to restore wallets.</li>
<li>An encrypted key is also 64 letters long and is a regular private key that has gone through the process of encryption, as defined above.</li>
<li>Example: If the world ‘Apple’ was your shortened private key, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new shortened encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’. Since you know the way to encrypt this key, you could derive the original private key from it by reversing the method of encryption.</li>
<li>Usually, encrypted private keys are kept within the extension or device they are encrypted by, and they remain out of sight from the user. This is meant to add another layer of security to keep a user’s wallet information safe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Decentralize-Decentralization"><a href="#Decentralize-Decentralization" class="headerlink" title="Decentralize / Decentralization"></a><strong>Decentralize / Decentralization</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The process of transferring authority from a single entity (ex. Government or large corporation) to multiple smaller entities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Smart-Contracts"><a href="#Smart-Contracts" class="headerlink" title="Smart Contracts"></a><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A piece of code (or program) that is stored on the blockchain network.</li>
<li>Conditions of the contract are predefined by the users, if all conditions are met, certain actions are executed by the contract (program).</li>
<li>Read more about smart contracts <a href="/en/diving-deeper/what-is-a-smart-contract/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Blockchain"><a href="#Blockchain" class="headerlink" title="Blockchain"></a><strong>Blockchain</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A decentralized, publicly-owned ledger.</li>
<li>Immutable, unable to be edited, permanent.</li>
<li>Maintained by remote miners all over the world.</li>
</ul>

<li>Open-source means anyone can view, copy, or make suggestions to our code on <a href="https://github.com/MyEtherWallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Client-side means we do not have behind-the-scenes servers.</li>

<h2 id="Where-are-my-funds-stored-then"><a href="#Where-are-my-funds-stored-then" class="headerlink" title="Where are my funds stored then?"></a><strong>Where are my funds stored then?</strong></h2><ul>
<li>All ETH and tokens are stored on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
<li>When using any site, exchange, hardware wallet, or interface based on the blockchain, all crypto is stored on the blockchain itself. These platforms and hardware wallets just allow us to interact with the blockchain in a simplified way.</li>
<li>The Ethereum blockchain is not owned by a centralized entity, but is verified and maintained by thousands of remote people called ‘miners’ who use their time and energy to keep it all in check.</li>
<li>This is why our site, and sites like <a href="https://etherscan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a> and <a href="https://ethplorer.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethplorer</a>, are able to pull your wallet information. Not because of behind-the-scenes servers, but because they are pulling information from the blockchain itself. </li>

<h2 id="Mnemonic-Phrase-Extra-Word"><a href="#Mnemonic-Phrase-Extra-Word" class="headerlink" title="Mnemonic Phrase (+ Extra Word)"></a><strong>Mnemonic Phrase (+ Extra Word)</strong></h2><p>This is a list of 12 to 24 words that are generated and given to users upon certain forms of wallet creation (i.e. MEWconnect, MetaMask, Hardware Wallets, JAXX wallets, etc.). Sometimes these phrases have an extra word associated with them, and sometimes they do not. The order and spelling of the words in a mnemonic phrase is directly tied to one’s private key, and therefore is not recommended as a regular way to access a wallet. It is best to only use this phrase for recovery purposes.</p>

<h2 id="Private-Key"><a href="#Private-Key" class="headerlink" title="Private Key"></a><strong>Private Key</strong></h2><p>The private key is a string of 64 characters tied permanently to a public address. This is sometimes given to users when wallets are created and sometimes kept encrypted (in the case of MEWconnect, MetaMask, and Hardware Wallets). <em>Using one’s private key should always be a last-ditch effort of access, only to be utilized when all else fails.</em> This should not be the main method of entry for anyone to access their wallets. Private keys are the number one most sensitive information anyone can have for a wallet, because private keys allow immediate access and can never be changed. Therefore, it is extremely important to keep this safe, secure, and secret.</p>

<p>If you are getting an error message saying ‘Window Blocked’ when using a Trezor, Ledger, or MetaMask to confirm a transaction, this is because you are blocking pop-ups with the browser. </p>
<p>To fix this issue, you will need to ‘Allow Pop-Ups’ for MyEtherWallet.com.</p>
<p>This allows information to safely be sent to your device/extension so that the transaction can be signed and safely sent via our infrastructure.</p>

<p>BC Vault Hardware Wallets are leading wallets for their security and interface usability standards. They are available for purchase <a href="https://bc-vault.com/?wpam_id=53" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. </p>
<p><em>Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</em></p>
<p>Hardware wallets often support multiple cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>
<p><strong>This part is very important.</strong> Your BC Vault device comes as its own SEPARATE wallet. You should not import your old MEW address into this, or use your old wallet with it. It has its own private key, encrypted into the device itself. You will be choosing a new ethereum address on this device, and using it as your new main wallet.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s begin!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="The-Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#The-Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="The Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>The Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unbox your BC Vault! Plug it into your computer and download the <a href="https://bc-vault.com/#downloader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BC Vault Desktop Application</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>You may want to pin it to your taskbar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Open the BC Vault Desktop Application and look to your device. The first time you set-up your device, you will need to shake it to initialize the random number generation. Once you’re done, the device should connect. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> The BC Vault desktop application will take you through a set-up tutorial for your Global Password. Make sure you pay close attention to the information shown. A few key things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read extra tips. This is your money, and it’s your responsibility.</li>
<li>Nobody can recover or change this information for you, so you need to remember it. Write it down and store it somewhere safe. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once you’re done, you will see a screen to create your first wallet. Before you do that, head to the settings section in the top-right. Familiarize yourself with this section and change any settings for your comfort. You can also update your firmware here.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> It’s extremely important you back up your wallet through the Settings section. You can use an SD card or a series of QR codes, whichever you’re more comfortable with. Just don’t lose it!</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> When you’re ready, head back to the main screen and select ‘Add New Wallet’. Choose Ethereum, name it, and continue to set up your new wallet. </p>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> You’re done! You’ve now created a new wallet with BC Vault.</p>

<h2 id="Using-BC-Vault-with-MEW"><a href="#Using-BC-Vault-with-MEW" class="headerlink" title="Using BC Vault with MEW"></a><strong>Using BC Vault with MEW</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Attach your BC Vault device and head to MyEtherWallet.com.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On MEW, select ‘Access My Wallet’ &gt; ‘Hardware’ &gt; ‘BC Vault’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will ask for a Global Password on the website and a Pin on the device. Enter your information to connect to your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Select the address you want to use with MEW.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong>  You should now be taken to a screen that shows your new wallet address on MEW. Great job! You’re officially using your new BC Vault hardware wallet! </p>

<h2 id="What-About-My-Old-Wallet"><a href="#What-About-My-Old-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="What About My Old Wallet???"></a><strong>What About My Old Wallet???</strong></h2><p>If you are coming from an old wallet and want your ETH and tokens on your new, secure BC Vault address, you will need to send your funds to your new address through regular transactions. This can be achieved by accessing your old wallet through MEW wallet, MetaMask, Keystore file, or private key (however you usually did it before the BC Vault). From here, send your ETH and tokens to your new BC Vault address, ready to be accessed in a more secure fashion.</p>
<p>Please be advised ETH will be required for gas to move any tokens held in your old wallet. We recommend holding .01 ETH to cover 2 - 3 transactions.</p>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting"><a href="#Troubleshooting" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshooting"></a><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></h2><p>Most issues with the BC Vault can be fixed by performing a hard refresh (using CTRL+F5), confirming that all the firmware is updated to its latest release, and trying a new connecting cable. </p>

<h2 id="The-Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#The-Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="The Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>The Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unbox your Digital BitBox! Plug it into your computer and download the <a href="https://shiftcrypto.ch/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital BitBox Desktop App</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may want to pin it to your taskbar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In the Digital BitBox Desktop App interface, select ‘Create a new wallet’. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Set up a password to access your Digital BitBox. Make it something that is very easy to remember for you. Write it down in a couple places. Remember it!! This is how you will unlock your wallet everytime you want to access it.  </p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This is one of the most important steps. To recover your device in the future, you will need both the SD card AND your choice of recovery password. Do not write this recovery password down on your computer, do not take a picture of the password. Make sure you write down your recovery password in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE IT. If you lose this password and the SD card it’s attached to, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency. We suggest using multiple pieces of paper to write this down. Again, do not write this password down on your computer. Use pen and paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you remove and take good care of that SD card! </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Great, your device is now ready! Now let’s figure out how to use it with MyEtherWallet.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will ask for a password. Enter your password to connect to your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> You will see a bunch of addresses here. Make sure you’re on the Ethereum network, using the standard Ethereum derivation path, and then choose your address.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no right or wrong choice for choosing an address, it’s up to you. But choosing the first one is usually the best practice, for convenience and memory’s sake.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong>  You should now be taken to a screen that looks very similar to your old wallet’s access screen. Great job! You’re officially using your new Digital BitBox hardware wallet! </p>

<p>CoolWallet Hardware Wallets are leading wallets for their sleek design, uncompromising security, and bluetooth capabilities. They are available for purchase <a href="https://www.coolwallet.io/product/coolwallet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. </p>
<p><em>Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</em></p>
<p>Hardware wallets often support multiple cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>

<h2 id="The-Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#The-Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="The Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>The Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unbox your CoolWallet! Pull out your phone, make sure Bluetooth is turned on, and download the CoolWallet Mobile App, CoolBitX, by scanning the QR code from the CoolWallet tutorial, included with your device. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Turn on your device by pressing and holding the main button. You will be asked to pair your device. Open the mobile app to  connect the device.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t see it, try restarting the device, the app, or turning your bluetooth on and off again. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enter the pin you see on your CoolWallet device into the app, then press the button on your device. This will complete the pairing process. After you’re done, you can click ‘Create’ to create your wallet.  </p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This is one of the most important steps. To recover your device in the future, you will need this recovery phrase. The app lets you select a length of phrase, this is your choice. Do not write this recovery phrase down on your computer, do not take a picture of the phrase. Make sure you write down your recovery phrase in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE IT. If you lose this phrase, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency. We suggest using multiple pieces of paper to write this down. Again, do not write this phrase down on your computer. Use pen and paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is paper provided in the CoolWallet set-up box to write down this phrase.</li>
<li>CoolWallet gives their recovery phrase in numeric format instead of traditional words. For more information on why, <a href="https://help.coolwallet.io/article/73-why-is-the-seed-generated-from-coolwallet-s-in-numeric-format" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out their answer</a>. We recommend copying both the numbers and their word equivalents, just in case.</li>
<li>After you’re done, you’ll need to add up all the numbers in your phrase to verify it was written correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Great, your device is now ready! Now let’s figure out how to use it with MyEtherWallet.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On MEW, select ‘Access My Wallet’ &gt; ‘Hardware’ &gt; ‘CoolWallet’. It should ask for a pairing password.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the bluetooth on your computer is also turned on. You may need to manually pair it with your computer. This can be done with a pairing password generated from the CoolWallet device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> On your CoolWallet mobile app, select ‘Show Pairing Password’. This will generate a password to pair with MEW. Type this password in then close your app before continuing. Once you’re done, select ‘Unlock CoolWallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> You will see a bunch of addresses here. Feel free to choose your address.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no right or wrong choice for choosing an address, it’s up to you. But choosing the first one is usually the best practice, for convenience and memory’s sake.</li>

<p>When accessing a hardware wallet, you’re given the choice of which derivation path to use. Most of the time it’s best to use the default path for familiarity, since each path leads to a different set of addresses. However, there are occassions where a different path is necessary. We’ve included the ability to add custom derivation paths so you can connect to whichever path you’d like. To read more about Derivation Paths, check out our article <a href="https://medium.com/myetherwallet/hd-wallets-and-derivation-paths-explained-865a643c7bf2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to the MEW homepage and select ‘Access My Wallet’, then choose ‘Hardware Wallet’. </p>
<ul>
<li>This can also be done via Mnemonic Phrase access. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> After selecting your Hardware Wallet, a screen like the one below should appear. Click the small arrow to expand a larger list of Derivation Path options.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose ‘Custom Path’ on the bottom-right and enter the details of the custom path you’d like to connect through.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/custompath1.jpg" width="70%">

<p><strong>You’re all set!</strong> After you’ve added your custom path, you should see a different list of addresses to connect to.</p>

<p>If you would like to use your Ledger hardware wallet with an android device, there are a couple things you will need to prepare in advance.</p>
<h2 id="Requirements"><a href="#Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Requirements"></a><strong>Requirements</strong></h2><ul>
<li><p>Modern android phone or tablet, supporting USB On-The-Go (USB-OTG).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re not sure of USB-OTG support, check it yourself using an app like the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faitaujapon.otg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USB-OTB Checker</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A USB-OTG adapter (found on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=usb+otg+adapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> for a couple bucks).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setting-Up-Your-Device"><a href="#Setting-Up-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up Your Device"></a><strong>Setting Up Your Device</strong></h2><p>Before connecting to your Ledger, you first have to install a <a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/android-u2f-bridge/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ledger application</a>. Click that URL on your Android device, and select the file <code>android-u2f-bridge-x.x.apk</code>. Once downloaded, open this file on your device and install it. Click ‘done’ when you are finished.</p>
<p>Now you can connect your Ledger hardware wallet and open the Ethereum app. Make sure ‘Contract Data’ is turned on. Now open your browser and head to MyEtherWallet.com. Under ‘Access My Wallet’, choose the ‘Hardware’ option and click ‘Ledger Wallet’ to connect to your device.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallets/ledger-hardware-wallet-using-with-android-01.png" width="50%">

<p>You should see this pop-up, asking to allow the app Ledger U2F to access the USB device. Select ‘OK’, and you will be connected to your Ledger!</p>

<p>KeepKey Hardware Wallets are leading wallets for their security and interface usability standards. They are available for purchase <a href="https://keepkey.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/keepkey-the-simple-bitcoin-hardware-wallet/?source=hasoffers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</em></p>
<p>Hardware wallets often support multiple cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>
<p><strong>This part is very important.</strong> Your KeepKey device comes as its own SEPARATE wallet. You should not import your old MEW address into this, or use your old wallet with it. It has its own private key, encrypted into the device itself. You will be choosing a new ethereum address on this device, and using it as your new main wallet.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s begin!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="The-Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#The-Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="The Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>The Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unbox your KeepKey! Plug it into your computer and download the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepkey-client/idgiipeogajjpkgheijapngmlbohdhjg?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KeepKey Client browser extension</a> application. </p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not a typical browser extension that shows on your browser like MetaMask. You may want to pin it to your taskbar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In the KeepKey Client interface, select ‘Initialize Device’. </p>
<ul>
<li>Set your label (name) for your device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Set up a PIN code to access your KeepKey. Make it something that is very easy to remember for you. Write it down in a couple places. Remember it!! This is how you will unlock your wallet everytime you want to access it. The PIN code must be between 4 and 8 characters. </p>
<ul>
<li>Keep them in the correct order, too!</li>
<li>The pin numbers will appear on the actual device itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This is one of the most important steps. Do not write this phrase down on your computer, do not take a picture of the phrase. Make sure you write down your 12 seed words in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE THEM. If you lose these words, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency. We suggest using multiple pieces of paper to write this down. Again, do not write this phrase down on your computer. Use pen and paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>The phrase also appears on the device itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Great, your device is now ready! Now let’s figure out how to use it with MyEtherWallet.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Using-KeepKey-with-MEW"><a href="#Using-KeepKey-with-MEW" class="headerlink" title="Using KeepKey with MEW"></a><strong>Using KeepKey with MEW</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Attachand unlock your KeepKey device. Open your KeepKey Client and download the Ethereum account software to your device by choosing ‘Add Account’ in the bottom right corner.</p>
<ul>
<li>After you’re done, close the KeepKey client and unplug/replug your device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now head to MyEtherWallet.com. Select ‘Access My Wallet’ &gt; ‘Hardware’ &gt; ‘KeepKey’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enter your pin to connect to your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> You will see a bunch of addresses here. Make sure you’re on the Ethereum network, using the standard Ethereum derivation path, and then choose your address.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no right or wrong choice for choosing an address, it’s up to you. But choosing the first one is usually the best practice, for convenience and memory’s sake.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong>  You should now be taken to a screen that looks very similar to your old wallet’s access screen. Great job! You’re officially using your new KeepKey hardware wallet! </p>
<hr>
<h2 id="What-About-My-Old-Wallet"><a href="#What-About-My-Old-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="What About My Old Wallet???"></a><strong>What About My Old Wallet???</strong></h2><p>If you are coming from an old wallet and want your ETH and tokens on your new, secure KeepKey address, you will need to send your funds to your new address through regular transactions. This can be achieved by accessing your old wallet through MEW wallet, MetaMask, Keystore file, or private key (however you usually did it before the KeepKey). From here, send your ETH and tokens to your new KeepKey address, ready to be accessed in a more secure fashion.</p>
<p>Please be advised ETH will be required for gas to move any tokens held in your old wallet. We recommend holding .01 ETH to cover 2 - 3 transactions.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-I-Restore-My-KeepKey-to-a-New-Device"><a href="#How-Do-I-Restore-My-KeepKey-to-a-New-Device" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Restore My KeepKey to a New Device?"></a><strong>How Do I Restore My KeepKey to a New Device?</strong></h2><p>You can use your recovery phrase to restore your wallet to as many devices as you’d like, as long as they accept the 12-word mnemonic phrase for recovery.</p>
<h2 id="Troubleshooting"><a href="#Troubleshooting" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshooting"></a><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></h2><p>Most issues with the KeepKey can be fixed by performing a hard refresh (using CTRL+F5), confirming that all the firmware is updated to its latest release, and trying a new connecting cable. </p>

<p>Ledger Hardware Wallets are some of the most secure and intuitive cryptocurrency hardware wallets out there. They are available for purchase <a href="https://www.ledger.com/?r=fa4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</em></p>
<p>This particular hardware wallet supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>

<h2 id="Using-Ledger-with-MEW"><a href="#Using-Ledger-with-MEW" class="headerlink" title="Using Ledger with MEW"></a><strong>Using Ledger with MEW</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Attach and unlock your Ledger device. You should see a few different sections to choose from, choose the Ethereum section as shown above. Click both buttons to open it.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/ethereum-app.jpg" width="50%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click into this Setting section with both buttons.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/ethereum-settings.jpg" width="50%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will see “Contract Data” in this section. Make sure this option is turned to “Yes”.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Good job, it’s all ready now! Head back to the “Ethereum” section and leave your Ledger alone for a moment. Let’s head to MEW!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Check the URL for the “MyEtherWallet Inc [US]” SSL certification to make sure you’re on our real, secure site. Are you? Great! Head to ‘Access My Wallet’ and choose the option that says ‘Hardware’. Click the ‘Ledger Wallet’ option, and choose ‘Connect With Your Device’ with your Ledger device still attached, unlocked, and ready.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/MEW1.png" width="75%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> A screen showing different networks and derivation paths should appear. Choose which network you’d like to connect to, and which path you’d like to use. For regular ETH usage, you should be on an ETH network, under the Ethereum derivation path. You can also access other networks, such as Ethereum Classic (ETC), by choosing the related network path. </p>

<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> You will see a list of addresses. These are your new addresses to choose from for your main wallet! Choose one out of the five that you like. (Most people choose the first one, but you don’t have to.)</p>

<p>Trezor Hardware Wallets are some of the most secure and intuitive cryptocurrency hardware wallets out there. They are available for purchase <a href="https://trezor.io/?offer_id=12&aff_id=2029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</em></p>
<p>This particular hardware wallet supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>
<p><strong>This part is very important:</strong> Your Trezor device comes as its own SEPARATE wallet. You should not import your old MEW address into this, or use your old wallet with it. It has its own private key, encrypted into the device itself. You will be choosing a new ethereum address on this device, and using it as your new main wallet.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="The-Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#The-Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="The Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>The Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unbox your Trezor! You will see some cards and instructions for set-up. Follow these instructions carefully! Plug in the Trezor to your computer and get started. Visit <a href="https://trezor.io/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trezor.io/start</a> to begin the process. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor1.jpg" width="35%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Choose ‘Create new’ on this page, and follow the steps to set up your new device.The first thing you will want to do is ‘Create a backup in 3 minutes.’ </p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor2.png" width="80%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> <em>This is one of the most important steps.</em> Do not write this phrase down on your computer, do not take a picture of the phrase. Make sure you write down your 24 seed words in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE THEM. If you lose these words, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency. Ledger provides cards for you to write them down for remembering, but I suggest writing them down in one extra place as well. Again, do not write this phrase down on your computer. Use pen and paper. When you’re done, you’ll see the screen below.</p>

<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor4.png" width="75%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Now you will be prompted to choose a name for your Trezor. This is the name you will see on your device whenever you plug it in. Choose something familiar and personal!</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor5.png" width="70%">

<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor6.png" width="75%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> You will now choose your pin. This pin will be the only way to access your device (besides the recovery phrase you wrote down, multiple times) so it’s very important to choose a secure, but easy to remember pin. Don’t just use <code>1111</code> or <code>1234</code>, use something a bit more random and secure.<br><em>Don’t make this mistake! If it says it could be safer, make it longer!</em></p>

<h2 id="Using-Trezor-with-MEW"><a href="#Using-Trezor-with-MEW" class="headerlink" title="Using Trezor with MEW"></a><strong>Using Trezor with MEW</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Attach your Trezor device and head to MEW.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor10.jpg" width="35%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Check the URL for the “MyEtherWallet Inc [US]” SSL certification to make sure you’re on our real, secure site. Are you? Great! Head to ‘Access My Wallet’ and choose the option that says ‘Hardware’. Click the ‘Trezor’ option, and choose ‘Connect With Your Device’ with your Trezor device still attached.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/MEW1.png" width="75%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> A screen will pop-up asking for you to allow MEW permissions to read the public keys from your Trezor device. Click ‘Allow once for this session’, and feel free to select ‘Don’t ask me again’, so this step is automatic in the future. Select ‘Export’ on the next screen, enter your pin, and you’ll be redirected back to MEW. </p>

<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor11.png" width="70%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> MEW will bring you back to a page showing different networks and derivation paths. Choose which network you’d like to connect to, and which path you’d like to use. For regular ETH usage, you should be on an ETH network, under the Ethereum derivation path. You can also access other networks, such as Ethereum Classic (ETC), by choosing the related network path.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> You will see a list of addresses. These are your new addresses to choose from for your main wallet! Choose one out of the five that you like. (Most people choose the first one, but you don’t have to.)</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor13.png" width="42.5%"> <img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor14.png" width="50%"></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> You should now be taken to a screen that looks very similar to your old wallet’s access screen. Great job! You’re officially using your new Trezor hardware wallet! </p>

<h2 id="What-About-My-Old-Wallet"><a href="#What-About-My-Old-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="What About My Old Wallet???"></a><strong>What About My Old Wallet???</strong></h2><p>If you are coming from an old wallet and want your ETH and tokens on your new, secure Trezor address, you will need to send your funds to your new address through regular transactions. This can be achieved by accessing your old wallet through MEW wallet, MetaMask, Keystore file, or private key (however you usually did it before the Trezor). From here, send your ETH and tokens to your new Trezor address, ready to be accessed in a more secure fashion.</p>
<p>Please be advised ETH will be required for gas to move any tokens held in your old wallet. We recommend holding .01 ETH to cover 2 - 3 transactions.</p>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting"><a href="#Troubleshooting" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshooting"></a><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></h2><p>Most issues with the Trezor can be fixed by performing a hard refresh (using CTRL+F5), making sure all the firmware is updated to its latest release, and trying a new connecting cable. </p>

<p>To change your password on MEWconnect, all you need is your phone and your 24-word recovery phrase. </p>
<p>If you still remember your password and do not have your 24-word recovery phrase, please read this article on <a href="/en/mewconnect/mewconnect-user-guide/">how to backup your wallet</a> (found in section 2). Resetting your wallet without knowing your recovery phrase will result in the permanent loss of your wallet.</p>
<p>If you do not remember your password and do not have your 24-word recovery phrase, there is nothing we can do. Retrace your steps and try to remember your password, or your wallet will be lost forever. </p>
<h2 id="Change-Your-Password"><a href="#Change-Your-Password" class="headerlink" title="Change Your Password"></a><strong>Change Your Password</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Reset your wallet, either on the login screen or under our ‘Info’ section. </p>

Some wallets will claim that they use a ‘Secure Enclave’, but what they really mean is just a ‘general secure location’ within the device. Apple has guidelines and restrictions in place that do not allow the use of their Secure Enclave technology for crypto purposes, intentional or not. This is for a variety of reasons.  </p>
<p>The first reason is <strong>lack of support</strong>. The Secure Enclave of iPhones is a separate piece of hardware disconnected from the rest of the phone. This hardware cannot be accessed, altered, backed up, or upgraded by anyone, including Apple. And the current framework of the Secure Enclave does not host the capabilities of generating Ethereum keypairs. Therefore, it is not possible for any companies to use this hardware as a method of generating and storing Ethereum keys. Future upgrades to the encryption algorithms used by the Secure Enclave may change this, but it’s not likely to happen soon and would only apply to all future devices. </p>
<p>Even if they started offering this support with future versions, the second issue makes it very unwise to implement. This is mainly due to one reason listed in particular, <strong>no back-up services</strong>. Currently, MEWconnect gives 24 words for recovery, should a user get a new phone or break their current one. However, the inaccessibility of Apple’s Secure Enclave technology makes it impossible to design a recovery process, making each wallet generated by this technology vulnerable to being lost forever. </p>
<p>Instead, MEWconnect uses a local, secure keychain to encrypt and store the private information tied to one’s wallet. This information never leaves the device, so connecting to MEW and sending transactions is still just as secure. We believe transparency and honesty are important, so these distinctions have to be made. </p>

<p>These random V2 JSON files always make things complex. We apologize in advance.</p>
<p>You need to convert it to the standard V3 (‘Keystore / UTC’) file. The easiest way is using geth.</p>
<p>Download <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the appropriate version of the geth</a> based on your operating system.</p>
<p>Once you download it, extract the zip. Also copy your V2 JSON file into the same folder.</p>
<p>There are really explicit instructions for PC and Mac users <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/465/How-to-import-a-plain-private-key-into-geth-or-mist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now you have to open a command line window and type in the following command:</p>
<p><code>geth account import nameofyourwalletfile</code></p>
<p>This will import your file into geth and convert it to the latest (V3) keystore file. </p>

<li>Mac: <code>~/Library/Ethereum</code></li>
<li>Linux: <code>~/.ethereum</code></li>
<li>Windows: <code>%APPDATA%\Ethereum</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Copy that file, and select it on <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEW</a>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>Moving foward, use this file. Keep a backup of it (and the old file, just in case).</p>

<p>You can use both MyEtherWallet (MEW) and Jaxx at the same time, as both are client-side wallets that allow access to the Ethereum blockchain. There is no need to ‘import’ or ‘sweep’ your ETH from your Jaxx wallet to a new wallet with MEW.</p>
<p>Instead, use your Jaxx 12-word mnemonic phrase to <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/">access your wallet</a>. You will derive multiple addresses, choose the one you are familiar with. Both ETH and ETC can be accessed via this address, as well as various other networks we support.</p>
<p>To access your ETC (or other networks), access your wallet and change your network in the upper-right hand corner of your wallet’s interface. We offer multiple nodes for ETC, so choose whichever is right for you. (Don’t overthink it.)</p>

<p>If you are like many of our other users, you may be wondering how this will affect your wallet. </p>
<p>Fear not! MyEtherWallet (MEW) is still going strong at our current site, <a href="www.myetherwallet.com">www.myetherwallet.com</a>.</p>
<p>Here you are able to access the same wallet you used on the Vintage version of our site, through the same method.</p>
<p>You do not need to create a new wallet to use the new MEW site, you can use the exact same wallet you had on Vintage.-</p>
<p><strong>First, select ‘Access My Wallet’ on the homepage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then choose your usual method of access.</strong> For example, if you used a Keystore/JSON file on vintage you’d select ‘Software’ and choose the ‘Keystore’ option to connect.</p>
<p><strong>After you’ve connected, you’ll be taken to your Wallet Dashboard page.</strong> Here you can view your balances, send transactions, interact with Dapps, swap your crypto, and even manage NFTs! </p>
<p>We’ve come a long way since our days in Vintage, so it’s a good idea to take a few minutes and explore our new features. </p>

<p>First, it’s important to tell <a href="/en/getting-started/difference-between-mew-and-exchange/">the difference between an exchange and MyEtherWallet (MEW)</a>. </p>
<h2 id="Let’s-review"><a href="#Let’s-review" class="headerlink" title="Let’s review:"></a><strong>Let’s review:</strong></h2><ul>
<li>MyEtherWallet (MEW) is not an exchange.</li>
<li>MEW does not hold your information or funds. </li>
<li>The user is in complete control of their security. This means:<ul>
<li>If you lose your private key, we cannot retrieve it. </li>
<li>If you forget your password, we cannot locate or reset it.</li>
<li>We cannot reverse or refund any transactions. </li>
<li>If you are phished, the only way for the attacker to get your information is through your own use. We never had it.</li>
<li>We cannot look up your attacker’s IP address or information.</li>
<li>We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are decentralized, meaning there are no central servers or powers to control everything. MEW is client-side and acts as a doorway to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. In the same way that a door does not know who’s using it, cannot restore accounts, and cannot hold funds, neither can we.</p>
<p>What we DO offer is freedom and a true sense of security. You gain complete control over your finances and information. You have the security of knowing that even if MEW shut down, you could still access your funds with a number of other decentralized ETH wallet platforms, or even directly on the blockchain itself. You are the only one with your information, and if MEW gets hacked, it won’t affect you. Because your funds and usage are not stored in MEW. They are on the blockchain, and you access them anonymously. </p>
<p>Once you’ve made the distinction, you’ll be ready to <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet/">create your MEW wallet</a>. Before you do that, though, we suggest you read through our <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet/">‘Getting Started’</a> category. It contains all the knowledge you need to begin your crypto journey with confidence. </p>

<p>Many users use MetaMask for it’s ease of use and integration with many popular crypto sites, but they still want to have the functionality that MEW offers. For this reason, we offer support for MetaMask wallets right in our interface. Connecting is simple!</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure it’s the legitimate extension.<br>Are there a lot of users and positive reviews? </li>
<li>Is it offered by MetaMask.io? </li>
<li>If all of the above is true, you’re likely on the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Create your wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to choose a difficult password and record it on physical paper, just in case.</li>
<li>Follow the steps carefully, and make sure you write down the 12-word recovery phrase offered by the extension. This will be the only form of recovery for your wallet. Keep it safe.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Log into MetaMask and familiarize yourself with your new wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take special note of your public address (0x..).</li>

<p>Just like with all Ethereum wallets, the process begins with the generation of your <strong>crypto wallet key</strong>. This key is the foundation of your wallet, offering complete and permanent access to your account and all the funds involved. We recognize the significance of your private key, so <strong>we encrypt it with a master key</strong>. But we don’t stop there.</p>
<p>Your encrypted key is <strong>encrypted again</strong> with an access key depending on the method of access you use to unlock your MEW wallet mobile account. MEW wallet offers a pin code and biometric signature, such as a FaceID or fingerprint, as access methods used in the encryption process. </p>
<p>But we’re not done yet. This is where the process changes slightly depending on if you’re using an iOS or Android mobile device.</p>
<p>To make sure your key is protected, this encrypted key is <strong>encrypted again</strong> with a key generated from the Android Keystore section of your device, or the Secure Enclave if you’re using an iOS device. This specific key is not shared with us or any other apps in your phone, it is completely isolated architecturally within the local hardware of your mobile phone. </p>
<p>After that, we store this <strong>super encrypted key</strong> in a local SharedPreferences storage for Android devices, or the local KeyStore storage on iOS, which are also separated from the rest of the system on the software level.</p>
<p>This process may seem like overkill, but it’s necessary for the security of your information. When you make a new wallet with our MEW wallet app, you can rest assured that no one has access to your private key.</p>
<p>In fact, we don’t even allow our users to see their key. Instead, we offer a 24-word recovery phrase for backing up your accounts. This is generally viewed as the best method of recovery, which is used by most hardware wallets and wallet interfaces. </p>
<p>It’s recommended that you keep this phrase written down on paper, off of the internet, and stored in multiple physical locations. We cannot recover this information for you, which is a good thing. It means you have all the power and control over your accounts.</p>

<p><strong>This is for the security of your wallet. Your private key should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>MEW wallet utilizes <a href="/en/mewwallet/mewwallet-security/"><strong>multi-layer encryption and isolation</strong></a> to keep your keys safely stored away locally in your device. Your keys are heavily encrypted and completely separate from the outside world. </p>
<p>That means <strong>no one</strong> has access to them, including you. </p>
<p>Instead, the MEW wallet app offers a <a href="/en/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase/"><strong>24-word recovery phrase</strong></a> to back up and restore your wallet. This phrase acts similarly to a private key, so it’s important to keep it written down on paper and stored in a physical location. </p>
<p>Don’t type your phrase into a word doc. Write it down with a pen!</p>

<p>It’s always considered the best practice to keep your private key off the internet. There are rare cases where a private key is necessary to perform a specific task, like to claim tokens from a specific wallet, but most of the time the compromising nature of exposing your key doesn’t make the task worth it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Follow this link and check if your network type is already present. If not, you will need to prepare a few pieces of information about your network, such as the name, symbol, homepage, blockExplorer, and chainID.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> If you don’t see your network in the list, click ‘Create new file’ in the top-right corner of GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Name your folder the same name as the network you’re adding. </p>
<ul>
<li>Example using CLO: ‘CLO.js’</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Fill in your network type information with the format below, using CLO as an example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change all the references to CLO with the appropriate information for your network.</li>
<li>If you need to import tokens and contracts, you may first need to add those to the Ethereum-lists repo, found here: <a href="https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/tree/master/src" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/tree/master/src</a> </li>

<li>It’s a good idea to keep most of your naming and linking in all lower-case, except for the naming of your Types folder (which you’ve already done in Step 3). </li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you fill in your blockExplorerTX and blockExplorerAddr, make sure to replace the section of the URL that usually holds transaction hashes with ‘[[txHash]]’ and the section that shows the user’s public address with ‘[[address]]’ exactly as shown above. </p>

<p>Have you accidentally sent ETC to your ETH address? Are you curious to try ETH, but want to fool around on the Ropsten test network first? Or maybe you’re just interested in other networks that have forked off of the Ethereum blockchain? If any of the above are true, this is the article for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>We do not recommend using a Keystore File/Mnemonic Phrase/Private Key to access your funds. If you use one of these methods, we highly suggest <a href="/en/offline/offline-mew-looks-weird/">using MEW offline</a>, or <a href="/en/mewconnect-101-create/">creating a new wallet with MEWconnect</a> and transferring your funds. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your wallet’s overview page, you will see a ‘Network’ section in the upper right hand corner. Click the ‘Change’ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose the network you would like to interact with from this list. Your address will not change, but your funds will change to reflect the selected network. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you see multiple networks for your choice (i.e. ETC), there is no need to overthink it. Just choose whichever one you’d like, and change it to another if it seems slow or congested! </li>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Choose the network you would like to connect to, followed by the derivation path desired.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will notice there are separate derivation paths for ETC and ETH. You do not have to change to the ETC path in order to access your ETC. Changing the derivation path will produce a different list of Ethereum addresses than you may be used to seeing. Simply change the network to ETC, and feel free to access your familiar ETH address through the ETH derivation path. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Connect with your device, and you’re done! You will be directed to your wallet’s overview page on the desired network.</p>

<p>The first thing to understand is that MyEtherWallet (MEW) does not ‘create’ any private keys or public addresses. MEW (and other ETH wallet services) randomly generate private key/public address pairings for a user when ‘creating a new wallet’. </p>
<p>Every ETH address begins with ‘0x’ and is followed by 40 hexadecimal characters, for a total of 42 characters. Hexadecimal characters can be any character between the ranges of ‘a - f’ and ‘0 - 9’.  This means there are <code>16^40</code> possible ETH addresses, which is the same as <code>2^160</code> possible addresses. </p>
<p>That means there are <code>1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976</code> possible addresses to choose from. </p>
<p>Keys are not ‘picked’, though. The reason randomizing this process is so crucial is because our brains are flawed. We are not capable of achieving true randomization with our choices. If you choose your own private key, you will have access to a wallet of your choice. However, if someone else also picks that private key, all of your information and funds will be at their mercy. So we let technology generate these addresses for us, for true entropic generation.</p>
<p>To put all of this in perspective, there are approximately <code>7.5 x 10^18</code> grains of sand on Earth. That’s</p>
<p><code>7,500,000,000,000,000,000</code> grains of sand</p>
<p>compared to</p>
<p><code>1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976</code> addresses</p>
<p>That’s quite a difference. In fact, this number is so mind-blowingly big that, at one address per second, it would still take longer than the galaxy has existed (~13.21 billion years) to even make a tiny dent – and you would still be unlikely to run across an address with any activity on it! Not only that, but it would take more energy than the Sun can offer to even try and brute-force any specific address.  </p>
<p>The estimated age of the Universe itself is <code>~4.32 x 10^17</code> seconds old. In order to use up even half of the possible addresses in that amount of time, you would need to generate around <code>1.6 x 10^31</code> addresses every second. That’s 16 nonillion addresses every second, since the dawn of the Universe. And that’s just to use up half of them!</p>
<p>Even if the blockchain is vigorously active for the next ten thousand years, the chances of receiving a duplicate address are basically zero.</p>

<p>For increased security, you can run MyEtherWallet (MEW) on your local computer, instead of from the GitHub servers through our website. The main computer being used to generate the transactions should not be connected to the internet. You can generate a wallet completely offline and send transactions on a different computer, which must be connected to the internet, from our ‘Send Offline’ section. In this way, your sensitive information (i.e. private key, keystore file, mnemonic phrase) is kept on an offline device, and it is never transmitted off your device.</p>
<p>There are two ways to use MEW offline, through the use of PWA or by downloading the client.</p>
<h2 id="Using-MEW-Offline-as-a-Progressive-Web-App-PWA"><a href="#Using-MEW-Offline-as-a-Progressive-Web-App-PWA" class="headerlink" title="Using MEW Offline as a Progressive Web App (PWA)"></a><strong>Using MEW Offline as a Progressive Web App (PWA)</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> In order to use MEW as a PWA, you’ll first need to head to our website on Google Chrome and install MEW. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline1pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your <strong>online</strong> computer, scroll down to the footer to find our Offline Helper tool.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline2pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enter the address you’re sending <strong>from</strong> and click ‘Export JSON File’. </p>
<ul>
<li>Keep this safe, you’ll need it momentarily on your offline computer. Export it onto a USB for easy transfer.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline3pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> On your <strong>offline</strong> computer, access your wallet as you would normally.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will look a bit strange, since you’re offline.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline4pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> To the left, select ‘Send Offline’.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline5pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Scroll down and import the JSON file you received earlier. This will fill in a few details. After that, paste the address you’re sending <strong>to</strong> and the amount you’d like to send.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline6pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Now select ‘Generate Transaction’ and download the JSON file, or copy the Signed Transaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to use the USB from before for this step as well.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline7pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> Back to your <strong>online</strong> computer, head to the Offline Helper tool again and enter the Signed Transaction section. </p>
<ul>
<li>Upload the JSON file here, or paste the Signed Transaction, then press ‘Continue’. Details should generate in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline8pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> Double-check all your transaction details, then click ‘Send’. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline9pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 10.</strong> You’re done! You’ve just sent an offline transaction.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline10pwa.png" width="80%">

<h2 id="Downloading-and-Running-MEW-Offline"><a href="#Downloading-and-Running-MEW-Offline" class="headerlink" title="Downloading and Running MEW Offline"></a><strong>Downloading and Running MEW Offline</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> In order to set up your local MEW, start by <a href="https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloading the latest release of MEW</a>.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/MEWoffline1.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click on <code>MyEtherWallet-vX.X.X.X.zip</code> to download the file. Move this file to a USB stick (or another storage transfer device), and transfer it to your permanently-offline computer.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/MEWoffline2.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Plug the USB into your offline computer and extract all the files into the archive of the computer. Extracting the files is important, otherwise MEW will not open correctly and will look like a bunch of nonsense. You should end up with a folder containing these files: </p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/MEWoffline3.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> To open MEW, double-click the ‘index.html’ file. This will open MEW in your browser. You will get a warning saying it is unable to connect to the network, which is normal. You’re not connected to the internet. You won’t be able to see your ETH or token balances because of this, but these are viewable in a secure, public way by using an Ethereum blockchain explorer such as etherscan.io or ethplorer.io.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/MEWoffline4.png" width="80%">

<p>Congratulations, you’re running MEW offline! Make sure to repeat this process periodically, to ensure you’re on the most up-to-date version of our interface.</p>

This is an extra word of your own choosing tacked onto the end of your phrase. For example, if you’re making a 24 word mnemonic phrase, this will act as a <strong>mandatory</strong> 25th word every time you want to use this phrase.</p>
<p>Occasionally, this extra word is also referred to as a ‘password’, but this is misleading. It’s actually a 13th / 25th word to your phrase.</p>
<p><strong>The upside to this is extra security.</strong> If someone got a hold of your 24 word mnemonic phrase, they would still need your extra word to act as a 25th word in order to access your funds. This greatly increases the security of your phrase. </p>
<p><strong>The downside to this is integration with other platforms.</strong> Almost every other Ethereum wallet interface requires your mnemonic phrase to be in a 12 or 24-word format and does not offer the extra word option. Therefore, restoring this phrase through other Ethereum wallets can prove difficult. This extra word becomes necessary to see your wallet, so you will not be able to regain access through non-supporting wallets. </p>
<p>In the end, the choice is yours.</p>

Most of the time, the answer is no. </p>
<p>Most apps or extensions that use Mnemonic phrases, such as MEWconnect, MetaMask, and hardware wallets, do not include an extra word in their mnemonic phrase. They ask you to input a password for app access, but this is different than requiring an extra word for recovery purposes.</p>
<p>If you made your wallet directly on MyEtherWallet.com, you may need to use the extra word you chose during creation to restore your wallet. However, most wallets made through other platforms will <strong>not</strong> require the extra word. Simply toggle this option to the ‘off’ position and proceed with your recovery process.</p>

<p>If you are <a href="/en/offline/using-mew-offline/">using MyEtherWallet (MEW) offline and locally</a>, it is not possible to send transactions directly from the offline computer. To send or broadcast a transaction, an internet connection is required. To do this, you should use a second computer that is connected to the internet. This has the advantage of keeping your private key on a separate offline device that won’t be afflicted by malware or hackers. </p>
<h2 id="Find-the-Nonce-amp-Transaction-Details"><a href="#Find-the-Nonce-amp-Transaction-Details" class="headerlink" title="Find the Nonce &amp; Transaction Details"></a><strong>Find the Nonce &amp; Transaction Details</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to MyEtherWallet.com on your <strong>online</strong> computer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> At the bottom, in the footer, choose the ‘Send Offline Helper’ tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose the network you are interacting with. </p>
<ul>
<li>Leave it on ‘ETH’ if you are using Ether or ERC20 tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Fill in the address you are sending from, and our interface will generate a gas price and nonce for your transaction, along with other details</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Make a note of your nonce, export the JSON file, and move this file onto a USB.</p>
<h2 id="Generate-Your-Offline-Transaction"><a href="#Generate-Your-Offline-Transaction" class="headerlink" title="Generate Your Offline Transaction"></a><strong>Generate Your Offline Transaction</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Plug in the USB to your <strong>offline</strong> computer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Access the offline version of MEW on this same offline device. </p>
<ul>
<li>This is done by opening ‘Index’ from the file list with your browser.</li>
<li>If you do not have MEW downloaded for offline use, <a href="/en/offline/using-mew-offline/">this article will help you download the MEW web interface</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Access your wallet like you would normally, and choose ‘Send Offline’ from the menu to the left.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to use the ‘Send Offline’ tab instead of the regular Transaction tab, because the ‘Send Offline’ interface allows you to select any token for sending. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Import your JSON file from the connected USB. </p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, you can manually fill in your nonce, transaction details, and the address you are sending to, as well as other relevant data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> If you’re sending to a contract, extra data may cause you to need a higher gas limit. </p>
<ul>
<li>Excess gas will be refunded, so don’t be afraid to raise it as high as 100,000.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Click ‘Generate Transaction’, then copy the long string that says ‘Signed Transaction’ and paste it in a text file, or download a new JSON file holding your signed transaction’s details. Drag this text file or JSON file into your USB for the final step in the process.</p>
<h2 id="Sign-and-Send-Your-Transaction"><a href="#Sign-and-Send-Your-Transaction" class="headerlink" title="Sign and Send Your Transaction"></a><strong>Sign and Send Your Transaction</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to MyEtherWallet.com once more on your <strong>online</strong> computer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> At the bottom, in the footer, choose again the ‘Send Offline Helper’ tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Paste in your signed transaction, or import the new JSON file you just received, then press ‘Continue’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Review the details of your transaction then press ‘Send’.<br><br> </p>
<p>You’re done! Your transaction will show on an Ethereum blockchain explorer once it’s been verified. It can be searched using the transaction hash shown at the end of the process.</p>

<p>You may have noticed we have a disclaimer on our Keystore File, Mnemonic Phrase, and Private Key options for access. This disclaimer reads ‘This is NOT a recommended way of accessing a wallet.’ Why is that?</p>
<h2 id="Control-over-your-wallet"><a href="#Control-over-your-wallet" class="headerlink" title="Control over your wallet"></a><strong>Control over your wallet</strong></h2><p>Whether you’re using your private key, keystore file, or mnemonic phrase, each method is closely tied to one thing: your private key. This is what’s unlocking your familiar wallet, this unique key. If anyone gets their hands on this key, they will have full permanent control of your funds.</p>
<p>This means that if someone gets ahold of your mnemonic phrase or keystore file, they have full control over your wallet. Keystore files can have their passwords brute-forced relatively easily, if the password is weak enough. And Mnemonic phrases directly link to the same root private key, everytime.</p>
<p>This is why we do not recommend using these types of wallets, but instead use a wallet that keeps your key separate from the online world of peering eyes. MEWconnect, hardware wallets, and MetaMask are the most secure options we offer for access. </p>
<h2 id="Why-do-you-have-these-options-if-they-aren’t-recommended"><a href="#Why-do-you-have-these-options-if-they-aren’t-recommended" class="headerlink" title="Why do you have these options if they aren’t recommended?"></a><strong>Why do you have these options if they aren’t recommended?</strong></h2><p>At MEW, we believe that the blockchain and digital assets serve as instruments of financial freedom. As such, we believe that it is our responsibility, as a gateway to the ethereum blockchain, to give users the tools they need to protect themselves from scams, malicious actors, and human error while at the same time protecting the user’s right to choose. </p>
<p>MEW has taken strides to make sure that the most secure options for storing your keys are also the most convenient to use. We have also taken strides to ensure users are aware of the dangers of using non-recommended methods. However, should a user decide that employing a less convenient, high risk method of transacting it is likely because they feel that it is the method that best addresses their needs, and MEW honors their right to make that decision. </p>

<p>Be sure there is not a space at the beginning or end of your private key. We validate based on the number of characters. A private key has 64 characters, count to make sure you have all 64. If you saved another version (i.e. the UTC / Keystore file) it may also be worth trying that file as well. For more information about how to use a Keystore file, learn how to <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/">access your wallet</a>.</p>
<p>Please be sure that you are <strong>carefully and accurately</strong> typing your private key. A single wrong character will open a different wallet than is yours.</p>
<p>For reference private key looks like this:<br><code>afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890</code></p>

<p>MyEtherWallet (MEW) is a front-end interface that enables direct interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. Any Ethereum address (0x….) can hold both ETH and ERC20 tokens. MEW allows users to manage a variety of different funds on a single address.</p>
<p>Many exchanges will give separate addresses for separate tokens, but this is not necessary on MEW. Whether you store all your funds on one address or spread your crypto portfolio across multiple addresses is ultimately up to you. </p>
<p>Some users prefer to have their funds distributed across multiple addresses for the purposes of security, organization, or personal preference. Others find that keeping track of one wallet is easier. We suggest using whichever method best fits your needs.</p>
<p>However, remember that all Ethereum blockchain transactions require gas, which is always paid in ETH. We recommend having at least .01 ETH on all your addresses, for sending transactions when needed. Also, make sure to keep all your information organized. The more addresses you have, the easier it can be to lose track and forget essential details about your wallets.</p>

<p>Your Keystore/JSON file holds an encrypted version of your private key, which is simply your private key encoded into a cool, secret string of characters. Take, for example, the word ‘apple’. If you encrypted this word with a 4-character difference down the alphabet, it would look something like ‘dssoh’. At face value, you’d have no idea what ‘dssoh’ meant. However, if you gave someone this word and told them the way you encrypted it, they could then decode it back to the world ‘apple’! This is a <strong>very</strong> simplified version of how encryption works, but it gets the point across.</p>
<p>When you enter your password upon generation of your wallet, it takes your password and uses it to encrypt your Private Key into a Keystore/JSON file. The result is a file that looks a lot like gibberish if you open it, (which there is no reason to do, do not open your JSON file!). This file simply holds your encrypted private key within it, which is why you have to use your chosen password to unlock your wallet via this method. You cannot change your password without generating an entirely new Keystore/JSON file.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the strength of your password is directly related to the integrity of your Keystore/JSON file. If you choose a weak password, and a hacker gets hold of your encrypted key, they can bruteforce it until they discover what password you used. Pick a strong password for a strong encryption! </p>
<h2 id="To-change-your-Keystore-JSON-file-password"><a href="#To-change-your-Keystore-JSON-file-password" class="headerlink" title="To change your Keystore/JSON file + password:"></a><strong>To change your Keystore/JSON file + password:</strong></h2><p>As mentioned above, you cannot change your password without generating a completely new JSON file. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install our <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myetherwallet/nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEW Chrome Extension</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In the extension, add a ‘new wallet’ by entering your private key. </p>
<ul>
<li>This does not mean generating an entirely new wallet. It means to add your existing wallet as a ‘new wallet’ into the extension.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enter a strong password, and save the wallet. </p>
<ul>
<li>This will be the new password for your JSON file, so choose wisely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Head to the ‘My Wallets’ area of the extension and click the word ‘Details’ in the top-right corner of your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Enter in the password you just made.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> You will be taken to an area that shows your wallet’s information. You can download a new Keystore/JSON file from this area, and use that for future access.</p>
<p>After downloading the new Keystore/JSON file, you can choose to continue using our Chrome Extension, or go back to using regular MEW. However, since you’re using a Keystore/JSON file, we highly suggest learning <a href="/en/offline/offline-mew-looks-weird/">how to use MEW offline</a>, for the security of your information.</p>

<p>Mnemonic phrases, also known as ‘seed words’ or ‘recovery phrases’, are ordered lists of 12 - 24 words which bring you to specific and unique wallet addresses. Each phrase leads to a near infinite amount of addresses, but most wallet interfaces pick the first one from the list to use as your public address. When you use a phrase on MEW web, you’ll see the first five addresses with the option to view more. If you’re using our MEW wallet app, each additional account you add is just the next address down the list of addresses that is generated from your phrase.</p>
<p>These phrases are typically used for recovery, and they are not meant to be used as the main method of access for anyone’s wallet. These phrases offer permanent and direct access to one’s wallet, so they should be treated carefully.</p>
<p>They can sometimes be paired with an extra word as well, for added encryption and security. When wallets offer this service, the extra word is used as an extra added word to the end of the phrase. For example, 12-word phrases become 13 words, and 24-word phrases become 25 words. MyEtherWallet offers this service, but MEW wallet does not. This means that mnemonic phrases generated directly on MEW’s website will have the option for an extra word at the end. But if you are restoring a MEWconnect recovery phrase on the web interface, you should leave the extra word field blank. </p>
<p>Mnemonic phrases are just as sensitive as your private key, in terms of privacy. With your phrase, anyone can permanently access your wallet. These phrases cannot be changed, so keeping them safe is crucial. </p>

<li>If it did, try entering your mnemonic phrase with the extra word you made.</li>
<li>If you already tried that, try entering the phrase leaving the extra word field blank.</li>

<p>Phishing and hacking are (unfortunately) very common in the crypto space. Don’t let it discourage you though, as most attacks are completely preventable. We will not be able to recover your funds for you, but we’re here to help however we can. Education is the biggest defense against these attacks. Being able to recognize and prepare yourself for future phishing attempts is very important. </p>
<h2 id="Step-1-Identify-the-method"><a href="#Step-1-Identify-the-method" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Identify the method."></a><strong>Step 1: Identify the method.</strong></h2><p>The first step is identifying how it happened. Phishers make their living by being sneaky, so being able to figure out their methodology will be tremendously helpful. </p>
<ul>
<li>Check your history. Have you recently visited any sketchy sites? Did you recently enter your information on a fake MEW after clicking a link? <ul>
<li>Look at the URLs. Do you see any tiny dots or accents over (or under) the letters?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scan your computer for malware. It’s possible your files have been compromised.</li>
<li>Do you have any remote-access software installed, i.e. Teamviewer? These can be hacked remotely to view the information right from your screen.</li>
<li>What method do you use to access your wallet? Private keys, keystore/JSON files, and mnemonic phrases are not generally recommended because they allow easy access to one’s wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Step-2-Make-a-new-wallet"><a href="#Step-2-Make-a-new-wallet" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Make a new wallet."></a><strong>Step 2: Make a new wallet.</strong></h2><p>Since your old wallet was compromised, you will need to discontinue its use and set up a new wallet. There are multiple safer options to choose from besides keystore/JSON files, mnemonic phrases, or private keys. </p>
<ul>
<li>The best thing you can do for your security is purchase a hardware wallet, such as the <a href="https://www.ledger.com/?r=fa4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ledger Nano S</a> or <a href="https://shop.trezor.io/?a=myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trezor</a>. These are generally around ~$100, but can save you thousands in the long run. </li>
<li><a href="/en/mewwallet/mewwallet-user-guide/">MEW wallet</a> is our fully fledged mobile app, which allows users to buy, hold, and send Ether and tokens right from their smartphone. It’s simple, fast, and secure.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaMask</a> is a free Google Chrome Extension that allows you to set up an Ethereum wallet, which can be used with MEW. MetaMask also warns you when visiting known phishing sites.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Step-3-Educate-yourself"><a href="#Step-3-Educate-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Educate yourself."></a><strong>Step 3: Educate yourself.</strong></h2><p>When it comes to crypto, there is no such thing as being too educated. This is a very new field, so even the experts have more to learn. The more you know, the more prepared you’ll be. </p>
<ul>
<li>A great place to start is with our <a href="https://kb.myetherwallet.com">Knowledge Base</a>. MEW maintains a variety of articles that can help. Start with our <a href="/en/security-and-privacy/pro-tips-how-to-avoid-phishing-scams/">Pro-Tips on how to avoid phishers</a>. </li>
<li>The force is strong with this community. Follow us on Twitter and Reddit for any current MEW-related scams or updates that might be going on.</li>
<li>Google everything! Before sending money to any service, search it on Google. Read people’s opinions on it, check Twitter and Reddit. Do your research!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Step-4-Let-the-world-know"><a href="#Step-4-Let-the-world-know" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Let the world know!"></a><strong>Step 4: Let the world know!</strong></h2><p>To avoid these scams, we need to know they’re happening. Take screenshots and write down what happened, while it’s still fresh.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send us the information! We cannot recover stolen funds, but we can help warn others. We’re always available at <a href="mailto:support@myetherwallet.com." target="_blank" rel="noopener">support@myetherwallet.com.</a> <ul>
<li>To make the process easier, make sure to include all relevant addresses, transaction hashes, screenshots, and details about how it happened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let people know on Twitter, Reddit, <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a>, etc. Blow up those comments. Let your voice be heard</li>
</ul>
<p>We know these attacks can be very demoralizing, but let it be an opportunity for learning. If these phishers deter you from using crypto, then they win. Show them that you’re a force to be reckoned with! </p>

<p>For instance, take a CryptoKitty. Each CryptoKitty is their own, separate NFT. No two NFTs are the same, even though they can represent similar things. </p>
<p>NFTs are very useful because they simulate real products and values that can be produced and transferred to prove ownership. They’re heavily used in blockchain gaming, where having unique items are treasured. </p>
<p>Since they’re built on the blockchain, their code and proof of ownership are immutable. You have full control over your NFTs, and no one can take that away from you. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/">Access your wallet</a>. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom1.png" width="85%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Search our default token list for the token you are looking for.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see the token, but don’t see a balance, it’s possible our default listing is for a token with the same symbol but a different contract address. In this case, continue with these steps as if you didn’t see it in the list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> If you don’t see your token, continue with this article.</p>
<h2 id="Looking-for-the-token’s-information"><a href="#Looking-for-the-token’s-information" class="headerlink" title="Looking for the token’s information"></a><strong>Looking for the token’s information</strong></h2><p>You will need three pieces of information to add a custom token with our interface: the contract address, decimal count, and symbol. All of this information can be found via an Ethereum blockchain explorer, like Etherscan.io or Ethplorer.io. We will show how to find this via Etherscan.io.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a>. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom2.png" width="85%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> If you have a balance of the token you are trying to add, search for your public address (0x…) in the search bar. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a balance and would like to add the token before receiving it, search for the token in the search bar. Make sure you find the correct token, or you will be adding another token to your list.</li>
<li>There is no harm in sending your ERC20 token to your address before adding it as a custom token. In fact, this may make it easier to find via etherscan.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom3.png" width="60%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Find your token in the token balances dropdown. Select the token to be taken to a token information screen. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom4.png" width="85%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Here, you will find the token’s contract address and decimal count to the right of the interface. Remember the decimal count, and click on the contract address to be taken to the token’s main screen.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Copy this address to your clipboard, and head back to MEW. At the top of the token list, click ‘+ Custom Tokens’ to bring up the custom token addition screen. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom6.png" width="50%">

<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Paste the contract address into the top field, input the token’s symbol (abbreviation) into the second field, and enter the decimal count last. Then click ‘Save’. You’re done!</p>

<p>If you see this error, there is a simple fix for it. Re-enter your custom token information, but put a ‘2’ after the symbol. I.e. If the token’s symbol is ‘XYZ’, enter is as ‘XYZ2’.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom8.png" width="50%">

<p>If you still get this error after submitting it with the modified symbol, then your token is likely already a default token. Try searching the token list again for the symbol. If you see it with a balance of 0, but etherscan.io shows a balance, then you’ll likely need to change networks to another ETH node, in the upper right-hand corner. </p>

<p>Lately, a lot of blockchain projects on Ethereum have been ‘airdropping’ tokens in the wallets of users. This is done to either spread the distribution of tokens, or to advertise the token to users.</p>
<p>The amount of airdropped tokens you receive depends (in a lot of airdrops) on how much Ether (ETH) you had at a specified block. Some airdrops drop the same amount of tokens to everyone.</p>
<p>That said, your Ethereum address is public on the blockchain, which means that anyone is able to send you ETH and/or tokens. If you want to find more information about airdropped tokens you received in your wallet, you can look them up on the internet for more information.</p>

<p>A ‘Token Already Exists’ error can occur when an incorrect contract address was added as a custom token. </p>
<p>To find the correct contract address, follow these instructions:</p>

<h2 id="Other-causes"><a href="#Other-causes" class="headerlink" title="Other causes:"></a><strong>Other causes:</strong></h2><p>This error can also occur if the symbol of your token is the same as a symbol already in our default list. To solve this, try adding the symbol with a ‘2’ after. </p>
<p>Using our above example, instead of ‘SNT’, you would add the token as ‘SNT2’.</p>
<p>This has no actual effect on the token itself, but is just a placeholder to make organizing your tokens easier.</p>

<p>Here at MyEtherWallet (MEW), we’re all about fostering a seamless user experience, built on a foundation of security. This is why we’ve partnered with multiple exchanges, such as Bity, Kyber Network, and Changelly, to bring you competitive price points for your swaps.</p>
<p>To utilize our swap feature, first you must <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet">access your wallet</a>. </p>
<p>In the wallet overview area of your account, you’ll see a ‘Swap’ option to the left. Click there to be redirected to our exchanging interface. </p>
<p>Choose the cryptocurrency you’d like to swap, and the second list will auto-populate with the choices we offer for that swap. The bottom of our interface will show which exchange is offering this price point, compared to other exchanges. </p>
<p>If all the information looks correct to you, simply enter the address you’d like to send the new funds to (feel free to use the same address as the one you’re sending from!) and press ‘Continue’. </p>
<p>A timer of 10 minutes will begin for you to review all your information, confirm the details, and send the transaction.</p>
<p>If you have issues with your swap, please reach out to the relevant exchange’s support team. Their emails are as follows:</p>

<p>During times of normal volume, transactions are mined within seconds and do not spend any length of time in the transaction pool. There is simply not enough time to cancel or replace or override a transaction once it has been sent.</p>
<h2 id="However…"><a href="#However…" class="headerlink" title="However…"></a><strong>However…</strong></h2><p>During times of extremely high volume, transactions could be pending for hours, if not days, before being mined.</p>
<p>During these times it is theoretically possible to replace an existing transaction with a new transaction with a higher gas price.</p>
<p>The second transaction, theoretically, will be mined before the first transaction, effectively “canceling” the first transaction.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is by sending a <code>0 ETH</code> transaction to your own address with the same nonce and higher gas price. This will “cancel” your first transaction.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee this will work, nor that it will work every time. This tool is very, very new. Please use at your own risk.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Copy and paste the transaction hash into the search field provided.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Details will appear depending on the state of the transaction. It could be…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Success:</strong> Your transaction was successfully mined and is on the blockchain.    <ul>
<li>If you do not see any errors, your transaction was successfully sent. Your ETH or Tokens are where you sent them. If this balance has not been credited to your hosted wallet or exchange account 24 hours after sending, please contact that service. Send them the link to your transaction and ask them, nicely, to look into your situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Failed:</strong><ul>
<li>If you see a red ( ! ) symbol, or a “BAD INSTRUCTION” or “OUT OF GAS” error message, it means that the transaction was not successfully sent. You cannot cancel or replace this transaction. Instead, send a new transaction. If you received an “Out of Gas” error, you should double the gas limit you specified originally.</li>
<li>If you see ‘Reverted’, it’s a good idea to double-check the actions you’re taking. This is an error having to do with a smart contract user-error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Not Found:</strong> This transaction cannot be found. It’s possible that it did not go through, or that it cannot be found in the Ethereum blockchain explorer you are using. Try using the other one (Etherscan.io or Ethplorer.io). If you still can’t find it, it never went through.</li>
<li><strong>Pending:</strong> Your transaction was located in the transaction pool of the explorer you are using. It is currently pending (waiting to be mined). There is a chance you can cancel or replace this transaction, but it’s a very small chance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="“Replacing”-vs-“Canceling”-Transactions"><a href="#“Replacing”-vs-“Canceling”-Transactions" class="headerlink" title="“Replacing” vs “Canceling” Transactions"></a><strong>“Replacing” vs “Canceling” Transactions</strong></h2><ul>
<li><strong>Canceling:</strong> Generating a <code>0 ETH</code> transaction to your own address with the purpose of preventing a previous transaction from “going through” / “being mined” / being included in the blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>Replacing:</strong> Generating a <code>XX ETH</code> transaction to someon else’s address with the purpose of doing something (i.e. sending funds, revealing an ENS bid, etc.) while simultaneously not having a previous transaction go through.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason we recommend ‘Canceling’ over ‘Replacing’ is that it is not guaranteed your second transaction will actually replace your first one. Your first transaction could still be mined first, invalidating your second transaction. Choosing to replace a transaction with a new one could lead to more confusion, headaches, and pending ETH, or ETH spent unnecessarily in the form of gas. This is especially true if your first transaction is mined anyways, which is possible.</p>
<h2 id="Canceling-a-Transaction"><a href="#Canceling-a-Transaction" class="headerlink" title="Canceling a Transaction"></a><strong>Canceling a Transaction</strong></h2><p>Canceling means generating a <code>0 ETH</code> transaction to your own address with the purpose of preventing a previous transaction from “going through” / “being mined” / “being included in the blockchain” / “being stuck”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to Etherscan.io or Ethplorer.io.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Paste your transaction hash.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it says pending, you can still try to cancel it.</li>
<li>If it says not found, click the button again, waiting a few minutes between each click. If that doesn’t work, it’s likely your transaction never went through.</li>
<li>If it says success, you cannot try to cancel it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> If it says pending, access the wallet you used to send the original transaction on MEW.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Send a transaction to yourself with a balance of <code>0 ETH</code>. </p>

<h2 id="Replacing-a-Transaction-Advanced-Users-Only"><a href="#Replacing-a-Transaction-Advanced-Users-Only" class="headerlink" title="Replacing a Transaction (Advanced Users Only)"></a><strong>Replacing a Transaction<br> (Advanced Users Only)</strong></h2><p>Replacing a transaction means generating a <code>XX ETH</code> transaction to someone else’s address with the purpose of doing something (i.e. sending a transaction, revealing an ENS bid, etc.) while simultaneously not having a previous transaction go through.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock the wallet you used to send the original transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Fill the ‘To Address’ field with whatever address you wish to send to.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Change the ‘Amount’ from <code>0</code> to the amount of ETH you wish to send.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> If sending a standard ETH transaction, you can use <code>21000</code> for the gas limit. If sending tokens, raise it to around <code>100000</code>. Otherwise, just leave as is.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> For the ‘Gas Price’ field, raise this to 10 GWEI higher than your previous transaction. If this is an urgent matter, then you may choose to raise it. Keep in mind, the higher the gas price, the higher the transaction fee (Gas Limit * Gas Price).</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Check and make sure the ‘Nonce’ field is the same as your previous transaction. If it is, leave the field as is. If you change this, it will not replace the transaction you are hoping it will replace.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Click the ‘Send Transaction’ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> A dialog will appear. Carefully review all information displayed. Click the “Yes, I’m Sure” button to send.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> A new transaction hash will appear. Click the link to view it and see if you were successful. If it doesn’t show up immediately, try waiting a few minutes then refreshing.</p>

<p>If you’re missing funds, you should first confirm that the transaction was broadcast successfully. If you have your transaction hash, plug it into the search bar at <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan.io</a>.</p>
<p>A successful transaction will look like <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcde5a30a1a1514919e9c357d4e89211701aa22a741936ad9516c2987d8b097c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>.</p>

<p>The lack of any red symbols or errors means that your transaction was successful! You can click on the ‘To:’ address on this transaction overview to redirect yourself to the funds destination. Make sure you double check the address to confirm it was 100% the same address you meant to send to. Even one wrong character will mean your funds were sent to another wallet’s address.</p>
<p>If you see an error on your transaction, this means it was not successful, and your funds never left their original wallet. You will need to try sending the transaction again, making a few changes to help it broadcast successfully. Depending on the error shown, it’s usually an easy fix. </p>

<p>If you are getting the error that looks like this: “Not enough ETH to send”, it means you do not have enough ETH in your account to cover the cost of gas.</p>
<p>Each transaction (including token and contract transactions) requires gas, and that gas is paid in ETH. You can think of this like a transaction fee.</p>

With tokens, the amount of gas is typically <code>50000 gas - 100000 gas</code>, so the total TX fee increases to <code>0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH</code>.</p>

<p>There is no minimum to transfer out of MyEtherWallet (MEW). We are not an exchange and have no way of blocking your withdrawals or deposits.</p>
<p>The only ‘minimum’ requirement is the minimum amount of gas needed to complete the transaction. For a standard transaction, that is <code>0.000441 ETH</code>.</p>
<p>If you have <code>0.000X ETH</code> in your account and want to empty your account completely, send <code>0.01 ETH</code> into the account and use the “Send Entire Balance” button to send the entire balance out. This will leave you with a balance of <code>0 ETH</code>.</p>

<p>This is a little easier to understand if you make the distinction that every wallet has two addresses. The first address is the ‘external’ or public address most people are familiar with (0x..), while the second can be considered an ‘internal’ address. All activity through the Ethereum blockchain starts with external addresses making some sort of action, but internal addresses are used behind-the-scenes with smart contracts to make small things happen. Whenever a smart contract needs to send ETH or make some sort of mechanic on its own, they call a function originally labeled as a ‘message,’ which eventually was renamed as an ‘internal transaction’. </p>
<p>This is a misnomer, because internal transactions are not actually considered transactions, as they are not included directly in the blockchain. Instead, they are more like a byproduct of smart contract functionality. Most importantly, they <strong>are</strong> reflected in the overall balance. They can usually be found under an ‘Internal Transaction’ tab, via <a href="https://www.etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan.io</a></p>

<p>Often times, a combination of new users, increased interest in Ethereum, games like CryptoKitties, and random ICOs can create quite a mess of the transaction pool, causing a lot of transactions to remain pending longer than usual. This is a network issue that affects all exchanges and ETH users.</p>
<p>There is simply not enough space in the blocks for the miners to mine all the transactions, and many systems are not currently set up to monitor the massive quantity of transaction requests. This is affecting all people’s ability to send transactions.</p>

<li>Try switching the network in the top-right to use a different node. There are multiple nodes that allow you to interact with ETH. We default to ‘MyEtherWallet.com’. If one is not working, try another one.</li>
<li>If you sent <strong>FROM</strong> an exchange, your best bet is to just be patient. Their support teams are generally flooded with requests (as are ours!), so patience is the best option.</li>
<li>There are additional issues created by this increased traffic that can result in unclear error messages on MyEtherWallet. We’re sorry for this, and we’re working on improving those messages. If you get an error, try pressing the generate button again, or changing the network via the dropdown in the top-right. However, be careful that you don’t actually send the same transaction twice. </li>

<p>MyEtherWallet (MEW) makes it easy for you to send a transaction. All you need is a wallet, the Ethereum address you’d like to send funds to, and a little ETH for gas. </p>
<p><strong>All transactions require ETH for gas. We suggest having at least .01 ETH for 2 - 3 transactions. Read more about gas <a href="/en/transactions/what-is-gas/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>If you plan to move large amounts of ETH or ERC20 tokens, we suggest sending a small amount first to make sure everything goes as planned. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/">Access your wallet</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the button that says ‘Send Transaction’, or find this section in the ‘Send’ category from the left menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Fill in the type of currency you’d like to send, the amount, and the address you’d like to send to. </p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to double and triple check the address you’re sending to! We cannot recover funds sent to the wrong address.</li>
<li>When sending your entire balance of ETH, choose the ‘Send Entire Balance’ option, so your gas is auto-calculated out of the total. </li>
<li>Gas and gas limit will auto-generate based on network congestion.</li>
<li>If you don’t see the token you’d like to send, you may need to <a href="/en/tokens/how-to-add-custom-token/">add it as a custom token</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click ‘Send Transaction’ and confirm the transaction on the next screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re using MEWconnect or a hardware wallet, be sure to confirm the transaction on your device as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Your transaction has been posted! Copy your transaction hash, for your records. </p>
<ul>
<li>Check your transaction hash on <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a> to make sure everything went through properly. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Ethereum network requires gas to execute transactions. Ether (ETH) is the fuel used for this purpose. When you send tokens, interact with a contract, send ETH, or do anything else on the blockchain, you must pay for that computation. That payment is calculated in gas, and gas is always paid in ETH.</p>
<p>You are paying for the computation, regardless of whether your transaction succeeds or fails. Even if it fails, the miners must validate and execute your transaction, which takes computational power. You must pay for that computation, just like you would pay for a successful transaction.</p>
<p>You can see your transaction fee (gas limit * gas price) in ETH &amp; USD when you search for your transaction on Etherscan.io.</p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a fee that MyEtherWallet, or any other service provider, receives. This fee is paid to miners for mining transactions, validating them into blocks, and securing the blockchain.</p>

<p>Every Ethereum address has two versions to it, one that includes uppercase letters and one that doesn’t. These are called the checksummed and non-checksummed versions, respectively. Take for example, the MEW donation address:</p>
<p>Non-checksummed version: <code>0xdecaf9cd2367cdbb726e904cd6397edfcae6068d</code></p>
<p>Checksummed version: <code>0xDECAF9CD2367cdbb726E904cD6397eDFcAe6068D</code></p>
<p>These two addresses include all the same characters and lead to the same destination, the checksummed one is just a little more useful for determining the accuracy of the address. Both versions of the address are viable and usable, but the checksummed version is the preferred version to use. If even one character of an address is off, any tokens or coins sent to the wrong address will be lost forever. This is not something to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will receive an error warning you that your address is not checksummed, preventing or warning you from making a transaction or adding a custom token. This is for your own safety. Do not be alarmed, though! </p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Input the address you’re interested in viewing into the search field.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will be taken to a page for the address, with balances and a list of transactions</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> At the top of the page, see the checksummed version with capital letters included</p>

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>The Ethereum blockchain is a network. Ether (ETH) is the fuel for that network. When you send tokens, interact with a contract, send ETH or ERC20 tokens, or do anything else on the blockchain, you must pay for that computation. That payment is calculated in gas, and gas is always paid in ETH.</p>
<p>You are paying for the computation, regardless of whether your transaction succeeds or fails. Even if it fails, the miners must validate and execute your transaction, which takes computational power. You must pay for that computation just like you would pay for a successful transaction.</p>
<p>You can see your transaction fee (gas limit * gas price) in ETH &amp; USD when you search for your transaction on Etherscan.io. This is not a fee that MyEtherWallet (MEW), or any other service provider, receives. This fee is paid to the remote miners for mining transactions, putting them into blocks, and securing the blockchain.</p>
<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a><strong>Overview</strong></h2><p>When you hear the term ‘gas’, the person speaking is either talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas Limit</li>
<li>Gas Price</li>
</ul>
<p>The total cost of a transaction (the “transaction fee”) is the Gas Limit * Gas Price.</p>
<p>You can think of the gas limit as the total amount of liters/gallons/units of gas a car can hold. </p>
<p>You can think of the gas price as the cost of that liter/gallon/unit of gas.</p>
<ul>
<li>With a car, it’s dollars (price) per gallon (unit).</li>
<li>With Ethereum, it’s GWEI (price) per gas (unit).</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s say you want to fill up your 10 gallon tank.<br>It would take 10 gallons of gas, at <code>$2.50</code> each. That total would come out to <code>$25</code>.</p>
<p>Likewise, fulfilling a gas limit of <code>21000</code> means filling <code>21000</code> units of gas.<br>If each unit is set at <code>20 GWEI</code>, your total would come out to <code>0.00042</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the total transaction fee in this scenario would be <code>0.00042 ETH</code>.</p>
<p>Sending tokens will typically take a bit more gas than sending ETH, so we generally recommend having 0.1 ETH for 2 - 3 token transactions.</p>
<p>You can use our tool to calculate GWEI &lt;-&gt; WEI &lt;-&gt; USD <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/convert-units" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, which can be helpful when you want to know your transaction fee in ETH, rather than GWEI.</p>
<h2 id="Gas-Limit"><a href="#Gas-Limit" class="headerlink" title="Gas Limit"></a><strong>Gas Limit</strong></h2><p>The gas limit is called the limit because it’s the maximum amount of units of gas you are willing to spend on a transaction. This avoids situations where there is an error somewhere in a contract, and you end up spending <code>1 ETH</code>, then <code>10 ETH</code>, and then <code>1000 ETH</code>, going in circles but arriving no where.</p>
<p>However, the units of gas necessary for a transaction are already defined by how much code is executed on the blockchain. If you do not want to spend as much on gas, lowering the gas limit won’t help much. You must include enough gas to cover the computational resources you use or your transaction will fail due to an ‘Out of Gas’ error.</p>
<p>All unused gas never leaves your wallet. So if you go to MyEtherWallet, send <code>1 ETH</code> to our donation address, and use a gas limit of <code>400000</code>, you will receive <code>400000 - 21000* = 379000</code> back. However, if you were sending <code>1 ETH</code> to a contract, and your transaction to the contract fails, you will use the entire <code>400000</code> and receive nothing back.</p>
<p><em>*<code>21000</code> is the standard gas limit for regular transactions.</em></p>
<h2 id="Gas-Price"><a href="#Gas-Price" class="headerlink" title="Gas Price"></a><strong>Gas Price</strong></h2><p>If you want to spend less on a transaction, you can do so by lowering the amount you pay per unit of gas. The price you pay for each unit increases or decreases how quickly your transaction will be mined.</p>
<h2 id="Will-increasing-the-gas-price-get-it-mined-faster-Does-setting-a-low-gas-price-mean-it-won’t-ever-be-mined"><a href="#Will-increasing-the-gas-price-get-it-mined-faster-Does-setting-a-low-gas-price-mean-it-won’t-ever-be-mined" class="headerlink" title="Will increasing the gas price get it mined faster? Does setting a low gas price mean it won’t ever be mined?"></a><strong>Will increasing the gas price get it mined faster? Does setting a low gas price mean it won’t ever be mined?</strong></h2><p>The transaction fees go to the miner who mines your block. When miners mine a block, they have to decide which transactions to include. They can choose to include no transactions, or they can choose to randomly select transactions. In order to encourage miners to include transactions in blocks you want to set a ‘gas price’ that is high enough to make them want to include it (since it is entirely up to them).</p>
<p><em>Most</em> miners follow a very simple strategy for inclusion. They include transactions they received sorted from highest gas price to lowest, then include them until either the block is full, or they reach one that has a gas price set lower than they are willing to bother with.</p>
<p>You want to set the gas price high enough so that a miner includes your transaction in a block. If you are in a hurry, you can set the gas price even higher, so that you jump ahead of everyone in line.</p>
<p>If you are not in a hurry, you just need to set a number high enough so that someone eventually includes your transaction.</p>
<h2 id="Why-should-I-set-a-low-gas-price"><a href="#Why-should-I-set-a-low-gas-price" class="headerlink" title="Why should I set a low gas price?"></a><strong>Why should I set a low gas price?</strong></h2><p>Because it’s cheaper, and because with the increasing price of ETH (compared to USD), a transaction that used to cost half a cent, may now cost a few cents. </p>
<p>More expensive transactions, like interacting with certain Dapps, can now cost a dollar or more! As a user, you should try sending non-urgent transactions with a lower gas price as the more transactions that occur at the lower gas price, the more likely miners will lower their minimums.</p>

<p>In Ethereum, every transaction has a nonce. The nonce is the number of transactions sent from a given address.</p>
<p>In English, a nonce is a number that can only be used once. In cryptography, a nonce is a one-time code selected in a random or pseudo-random manner that is used to securely transmit a main password, preventing replay attacks.</p>
<p>Each time you send a transaction, the nonce value increases by <code>1</code>. There are rules about what transactions are considered valid transactions, and the nonce is used to enforce some of these rules. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Transactions must be in order.</strong> You cannot have a transaction with a nonce of <code>1</code> mined before one with a nonce of <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No skipping!</strong> You cannot have a transaction with a nonce of <code>2</code> mined if you have not already sent transactions with a nonce of <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-does-it-matter"><a href="#Why-does-it-matter" class="headerlink" title="Why does it matter?"></a><strong>Why does it matter?</strong></h2><p>This value prevents double-spending, as the nonce will always specify the order of transactions. If a double-spend <em>does</em> occur, it’s typically due to the following process:</p>
<ul>
<li>A transaction is sent to one party.</li>
<li>They wait for it to register.</li>
<li>Something is collected from this first transaction.</li>
<li>Another transaction is quickly sent with a high gas price.</li>
<li>The second transaction is mined first, therefore invalidating the first transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why exchanges wait for you to have a certain number of confirmations before allowing you to trade freshly-deposited funds.</p>
<h2 id="When-using-the-Ethereum-blockchain-the-above-is-not-possible"><a href="#When-using-the-Ethereum-blockchain-the-above-is-not-possible" class="headerlink" title="When using the Ethereum blockchain, the above is not possible."></a><strong>When using the Ethereum blockchain, the above is not possible.</strong></h2><p>In Ethereum, this method of “double-spending” is not possible because each transaction has a nonce included with it. Even if you attempt to do the above, it will not work as the second transaction (nonce of <code>3</code>) cannot be mined before the first transaction (nonce of <code>2</code>).</p>

<p>Aave allows you to deposit and borrow 16 different types of cryptocurrencies while earning on your deposited collateral. Borrowed assets will accrue an annual interest that needs to be paid back when you’re done with the loan, but this accrual can be switched between a variable or stable rate.</p>

<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave1.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select ‘Dapps’ from the menu on the left or scroll down to our ‘Dapps’ section, then choose ‘Aave’.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave2.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Click the green button that says ‘Deposit’ to see the full list of assets you can deposit. The earning rates for each currency are listed under the ‘APY’ section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different assets have different earning rates and borrowing power. Browse the selection before making your choice. </li>
<li>Remember, you can always swap for the asset you want to deposit using our Swap page. </li>
<li>Your “Aggregated Balance” shows the Total Balance for your deposits. If you’ve deposited more than one type of asset, you will see the total value covered by all your deposited assets.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave3.png" width="80%">

<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave4.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> After you deposit, you will be sent a token in the form of ‘a_Token_’, which will be pegged 1:1 with the asset you’ve deposited. Once you withdraw your deposited assets, extra funds earned through the ‘a_Token_’ will be credited to your account.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, depositing 1 ETH will give you 1 aETH, which will slowly grow in balance as time goes on. When you withdraw, that extra balance will be credited to you.</li>
</ul>

After you’re done, head to the ‘Borrowings’ tab on the Dapp.</p>
<ul>
<li>The “You Borrowed” section refers to the Total Amount you’ve borrowed, including different types of assets. It will also show you how much you have left to borrow, signified by the “__% Available” phrase. </li>
<li>“Your Collateral” shows the total you have deposited for use as collateral. This is similar to the “Aggregated Balance” from your Deposits page.</li>
<li>Note the ‘Loan to value’ percentage at the bottom of this page. This is the amount of borrowing power your deposited assets hold displayed in a weighted average. For example, 1 ETH at 80% Loan to value will allow 0.8 ETH’s worth of assets to be borrowed. </li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave6.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the green button that says ‘Borrow’ to see the full list of assets you can borrow. Each asset has different interest rates that will need to be paid back after you’re done with the loan. </p>
<ul>
<li>You can filter the list between Stablecoins and All using the ticker located at the top-left of the list. </li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave7.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you begin the borrowing process, you will need to choose between a Stable and Variable rate of interest. Choose the rates that work best for you, listed under the ‘Stable APY’ and ‘Variable APY’ categories. Some assets offer both options, while others are tied to just one. </p>
<ul>
<li>If your asset offers both, you can switch between the two rate types whenever you want. </li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave8.png" width="100%">

<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave9.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> You can borrow multiple types of assets, but keep an eye on your Health Factor. This number represents the amount you’ve borrowed in relation to the amount you’ve deposited. If your Health Factor reaches 1 or below, your deposited assets become at risk of being liquidated. </p>
<ul>
<li>To raise your health factor, pay back some of your borrowed assets or deposit more for collateral.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/aave11.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> When you’re paying back your borrowed assets, you’ll need to pay a little extra to cover any interest accrued during the loan period. All of the assets listed can be swapped from our Swap section through one of our providers. </p>

<p>The Ethereum Name Service, also known as ENS, is a domain service that assigns a user-specific domain tied to your wallet’s account address. </p>
<p>ENS domains take the format of <code>YourDomainHere.eth</code>. The intention behind this is to simplify the normal public address into a form that is easier to use and send to others. There are other use cases as well, but this is the main reason for this service as of right now.</p>
<p>An easy example of this is our MEW donation address:</p>
<p>Normal donation address: <code>0xDECAF9CD2367cdbb726E904cD6397eDFcAe6068D</code></p>
<p>.eth donation address: <code>mewtopia.eth</code></p>
<p>Both of these addresses lead to the same wallet destination, but the ENS domain is much more convenient.</p>

<li>Always check the URL to make sure you’re on our legit site!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Access your wallet. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t already have a wallet, you will need to <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet/">create a new wallet</a>. </li>
<li>You will also need a small amount of ETH for <a href="/en/transactions/what-is-gas/">gas</a>. We generally recommend <code>.01 ETH</code> for 1 - 2 transactions. Initializing and finalizing ENS domains both count as a transactions.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ENS1-2.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Head to the Dapps section, to the left of your wallet’s overview page. It can also be found at the bottom of the page, under the ‘Dapps’ section. </p>
<ul>
<li>Here you will see the ‘ENS Manager’ option. Click there!</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ENS1-3.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Enter your desired domain name to see if it is available.</p>
<ul>
<li>ENS domains must be 3 characters or longer.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that the final product will look like <code>YourDomainHere.eth</code>.</li>
<li>You can also search Etherscan.io for available ENS domains.</li>
<li>If it says to migrate the ENS domain to the new registrar, that means it is unavailable (unless it’s already yours, in which case you should migrate it. All migrations must take place by May 4th, 2020.)</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ENS1-4.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> If your domain is available, you can register it. Select the amount of time you wish to own the domain and click <code>Register</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most longer domains cost the equivalent of $5/year in ETH to maintain, but the shorter the domain, the more expensive it becomes.</li>
<li>They can be owned indefinitely, as long as this annual fee is paid. </li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ENS1-5.png" width="100%">

<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> After confirming the transaction, your domain request will process for a moment. When it’s done, select <code>Register</code> again and confirm the second transaction.</p>

<p>MyEtherWallet, at the time of this writing, rate-limits at 400 requests per minute (or about 6 requests per second). This is in order to prevent DDOS’s like we have seen before, or people using our nodes to excess.</p>
<p>This should be more than enough for a single person’s use, but feel free to reach out to us about why you need more, and we can adjust.</p>
<p>If you are going to be using it more than 400 req per minute on average, or just want to ensure uptime, we strongly recommend you get your own node.</p>
<p>Our backend infrastructure is on AWS and is open-source via Docker + CloudFormation walkthrough. You can actually do it yourself and run your own public or private node via <a href="https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/docker-geth-lb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these instructions</a>. </p>
<p>Or you could pay a small fee and use <a href="https//quicknode.io/">QuikNode</a>, which makes it even easier.</p>
<p>For both of these options, you could connect to your new node via the ‘Add Custom Node’ option in the network selector in the top-right corner. Further details on how to connect to your own node can be found <a href="/en/networks-and-nodes/unable-to-connect-to-custom-node/">here</a>, or you could connect directly via API.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access your wallet and head to the ‘Contracts’ section, to the left of your wallet interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Locate your preferred Multisig Contract ABI in the dropdown, or manually enter the contract’s ABI. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Check the contract address to make sure it’s the one you’re looking for, then press ‘Continue’. </p>
<ul>
<li>You may need to enter your contract address in the ‘Contract Address’ field at the top. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Select ‘Execute’ from the dropdown menu. </p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the address you want to send to in the <code>_To</code> field.</li>
<li>Enter the amount you want to send in the <code>_Value</code> field. </li>
<li>In the <code>Data</code> field, type <code>0x</code>. This sets it to empty. </li>
<li>Leave the <code>Value in ETH</code> as <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Click <code>Write</code>.</li>
<li>Confirm the transaction and send. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Click the Transaction ID that outputs with the ‘Success’ message. Copy this ID.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> If it’s a multisig contract with two owners, you will need to refresh this page and choose ‘Confirm’.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Step 5, you opened the Transaction ID from the ‘Execute’ call. You should have a page like <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0c643a1ae66637217f24791df05071c7849941a1231cf9fa2a0daf145da833e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> open.</li>
<li>Click the ‘Event Logs’ tab.</li>
<li>For reference, at <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47e4cc8748e296d9b5d85ebd9bd705177bb1940517b084a2efcca11feeb2391d#eventlog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> link (note this is not YOUR link, it’s an example), the <code>_h</code> value would be <code>9228aeaf3ed560274899483646ea4ce9b322bccffac60cac2d035d08752617f4</code>.</li>
<li>Check the link above where it says that string, and then compare it to find what YOUR <code>_h</code> value is. It will be different than what we provided as an example. </li>
<li>Go back to MEW, where you have the ‘Confirm’ page open, and paste your string into the <code>_h</code> field.</li>
<li>Click ‘Write’ again.</li>
<li>Confirm and send the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Double-check to confirm everything went as intended.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> If your multisig is a 3 of 5 multisig, you will repeat the confirm process outlined in Step 6 until it reaches the necessary approvals. Luckily, the <code>_h</code> value will remain the same for each of them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> You can view another approval for our previous example <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47e4cc8748e296d9b5d85ebd9bd705177bb1940517b084a2efcca11feeb2391d#eventlog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.</strong> Feel free to repeat this process whenever you want to send ETH. </p>

<p>You can now use MEW as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing access to a faster and more stable version of our site directly from a shortcut on your computer desktop or smartphone. Using a PWA on your computer eliminates the risk of accessing a fake website or a compromised DNS, adding to the security of interacting with crypto services online. </p>
<p>On a smartphone, it enables the use of MEW’s interface as a real app accessible right from your phone’s app directory. This allows our interface to send notifications and be used offline, the same as any traditional smartphone app. </p>
<p>To make use of this feature, you first need to be on a supported browser (Chrome and Brave are MEW-recommended browsers).</p>
<p>Head to our web page and check in your browser settings for the option “Install MyEtherWallet…”</p>
<p>This will install the website to your computer as a PWA shortcut, making it available for easy access and providing an improved user experience.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at what a contract is. A contract generally outlines a relationship between two parties, bound by law. If one party violates that contract, actions can be taken against them for essentially breaking the law. Many beginning users confuse contracts and smart contracts, and while they can hold similar functionality, they are used for different purposes.</p>
<p>A smart contract is a self-executing contract, written in code, the primary purpose of which is to achieve a goal without the interference of a middleman. Smart contracts can be used to exchange money, property, shares, data, or anything of real value, while remaining decentralized and transparent. The contract itself regulates what action is taken, based on its code. Smart contracts will always achieve the same end goal, based on what input is being used. While regular contracts are meant to be permanently (or temporarily) binding to the law, smart contracts actually are permanent. They make their own laws with their behavior. Using a smart contract for any other purpose than their primary one is impossible. They are immutable, bound to the Ethereum blockchain and unable to be edited. This may sound a bit complicated or confusing, so let’s view it in a different light. </p>
<p>The original creator of smart contract technology was Nick Szabo. In 1993, he hatched the idea for a system similar to a digital vending machine. A user could input a value or data string, and the digital machine would execute itself based on the input to return a finite item. This is how smart contracts were developed. A simple example of this would be a user sending ETH to their friend, but only at a specified time. They could create their own smart contract to send the funds at a later date, deposit their funds, and the smart contract would self-execute to send the funds as specified without any further external input. </p>
<p>The Ethereum blockchain was created specifically to write and execute smart contracts. While Bitcoin technically supported the very basic smart contract of transferring BTC, this is generally regarded as only the tip of the iceberg. With a little innovation and creativity, smart contracts can be built on top of one another to create completely decentralized applications (Dapps) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In these cases, each smart contract performs a function, which triggers another function in another contract, which continues to develop until a complicated action is completed without needing any centralized authority to monitor it. </p>

<li>Multi-signature wallets, which require a majority of the wallet’s owners to agree on spending before the contract executes.</li>
<li>Managing relationship agreements between two users, i.e. buying insurance or property ownership.</li>
<li>Providing information or utility for other contracts to pull from.</li>
<li>Storing information, such as personal information, medical data, membership records, consensus ledgers, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>The use cases for smart contracts are endless. We are only beginning to scratch the surface of what this technology can offer, and how it will revolutionize the world. </p>

<p>Your ETH &amp; tokens are on the Ethereum blockchain, regardless of what service you use to access them. When you move them, you are sending them from one address on the blockchain to another. These are lines of code. Your wallet file, hardware wallet, the interface you interact with, or your private key do not have funds in them. These are ways of access, which give you the ability to prove ownership over digital coins that are on the blockchain itself.</p>
<p><strong>If you use a client-side tool like MyEtherWallet or Mist, Metamask, Exodus, or Jaxx,</strong> then you have the private key (or a similar method of access), and you control your funds <em>and</em> your key. You do not rely on Coinbase or Gemini sending your funds from their account to yours.</p>
<p>The upside is that you, and only you, control your keys. An exchange getting hacked won’t affect you. The downside is that you, <strong>and only you,</strong> control your keys. No one else has them, nor can they recover them, should they be lost.</p>
<p>If you do lose your private key or wallet file and password, you cannot prove ownership of an account, and you permanently lose access to your funds.</p>
<p><strong>If you use an exchange like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Polonix, Bittrex,</strong> then you have an account with that company, and they hold your ETH and your keys for you. They have their own account on the blockchain with all their and their customers’ funds in it. Then you have a username / password with them, on their servers, and they keep track of how much ETH they “owe” you.</p>
<p>This allows you to have the more traditional username / password account dynamic and do things like reset your password if you forget it, change your password if your password is compromised, and turn on 2FA. However, it also means that if the exchange loses ETH, it’s your ETH that is lost.</p>
<p><strong>If you choose to move from an exchange to a wallet where you control your keys,</strong> you need to make sure that you have multiple backups, stored in separate locations, of your private key / keystore file / recovery phrase. This will prevent loss in case your computer crashes or your house burns down or anything else.</p>

<p>You can access the full list of supported networks and switch between them through our Network/Node list, which can be found on your Wallet Overview page after accessing your wallet. We support a wide variety of nodes hosted from other providers, such as ETC. </p>
<p>You can use our swap function to swap between BTC and ETH, thanks to our partner Bity, but we do not offer support for BTC. We just offer the option to swap it. To receive the BTC, you’ll need a BTC wallet. </p>

<h2 id="Wallet"><a href="#Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Wallet"></a><strong>Wallet</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The interface / client that you use to manage your account(s).</li>
<li>Example: MyEtherWallet.com, MEWconnect, MetaMask, a hardware wallet (i.e. Ledger, Trezor, BitBox, Secalot, etc..), a Multisig Wallet Contract.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Account"><a href="#Account" class="headerlink" title="Account"></a><strong>Account</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A public &amp; private keypair that “holds” your funds.</li>
<li>Your funds are actually stored on the blockchain, not in the wallet or account.</li>
<li>Just like your Reddit account has a username (public) and password (private), so does your Ethereum account. For additional security, you can use a password to encrypt your private key which would result in a username (public) and password (private) and password for that password (private + more secure). Read more about this <a href="/en/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-keystore-file/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Account-Ethereum-Public-Address"><a href="#Account-Ethereum-Public-Address" class="headerlink" title="(Account / Ethereum / Public) Address"></a><strong>(Account / Ethereum / Public) Address</strong></h2><ul>
<li>You use this to send funds to an account.</li>
<li>Sometimes referred to as the “public key”, which is not accurate (as explained below).</li>
<li>A string made up of 0x + 40 hexadecimal characters (42 total characters).</li>
<li>In Ethereum, the address begins with ‘0x’.</li>
<li>Example: <code>0x06A85356DCb5b307096726FB86A78c59D38e08ee</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Public-Key"><a href="#Public-Key" class="headerlink" title="Public Key"></a><strong>Public Key</strong></h2><ul>
<li>In cryptography, you have a keypair: the public and private key.</li>
<li>You can derive a public key from a private key, but cannot derive a private key from a public key.</li>
<li>In Ethereum, the address “acts” like the public key, but it’s not actually the public key.</li>
<li>(Advanced) In Ethereum, the public key is derived from the private key and is 128 hex characters. You then take the “SHA3” (Keccak-256) hash of this (64 characters), take the last 40 characters, and prefix with 0x, give you your 42-character address.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Private-Key"><a href="#Private-Key" class="headerlink" title="Private Key"></a><strong>Private Key</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The secret half of your Address / public key pairing.</li>
<li>A string of 64 hexadecimal characters.</li>
<li>(Almost) every string of 64 hexadecimal characters is a private key.</li>
<li>If you hand-type a private key differently today than yesterday, you will access a different wallet. </li>
<li><strong>Never hand-type your private key.</strong></li>
<li>This is the key you need to keep safe. Without it you cannot access your funds. Although, you don’t need to save this raw, unencrypted private key in this format. You can save a more secure version of it (i.e. the Keystore File / Mnemonic Phrase).</li>
<li>Example: <code>afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Keystore-File"><a href="#Keystore-File" class="headerlink" title="Keystore File"></a><strong>Keystore File</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Encrypted version of your private key in JSON format (though it does not have a JSON extension).</li>
<li>A fancy version of your private key that is protected by a password of your choosing.</li>
<li>Safer than a private key because you need the password.</li>
<li>File name usually is in the format:<br><code>UTC + -- + DATE_CREATED + -- + YOUR_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_THE_Ox</code></li>
<li>Example of file name:<br><code>UTC--2017-07-02T20-33-09.177Z--06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee</code></li>
<li>Example of Contents:<br><code>{&quot;version&quot;:3,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;aa811d53-fe9a-44a2-bd1c-e737007b5591&quot;,&quot;address&quot;:&quot;06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee&quot;,&quot;Crypto&quot;:{&quot;ciphertext&quot;:&quot;f5a7cc8d4b8cf93510b0d0d057f3a52ac79fd48e619e0638c4ffd978ca180248&quot;,&quot;cipherparams&quot;:{&quot;iv&quot;:&quot;975ab00192e2dd74170e91ca59c0b0bd&quot;},&quot;cipher&quot;:&quot;aes-128-ctr&quot;,&quot;kdf&quot;:&quot;scrypt&quot;,&quot;kdfparams&quot;:{&quot;dklen&quot;:32,&quot;salt&quot;:&quot;0210f0d0b99e440dfbceb36373304638bac093a367ee7da6411cd165f7aa907a&quot;,&quot;n&quot;:1024,&quot;r&quot;:8,&quot;&quot;:1},&quot;mac&quot;:&quot;8197a747a3855a10546a2ff939c36470daed78e393b670efa0c12fe3b23dd7e3&quot;}}</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Mnemonic-Phrase-Recovery-Phrase"><a href="#Mnemonic-Phrase-Recovery-Phrase" class="headerlink" title="Mnemonic Phrase (Recovery Phrase)"></a><strong>Mnemonic Phrase (Recovery Phrase)</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Another fancy version of your private key, that is actually used to derive multiple private keys.</li>
<li>Usually, a 12 or 24 word phrase that allows you to access an infinite number of accounts.</li>
<li>Sometimes includes an extra 13th or 25th word chosen by the user, for added security.</li>
<li>Used by Ledger, Trezor, MEWconnect, MetaMask, Jaxx, and others.</li>
<li>Originates from BIP 39 Spec.</li>
<li>The accounts you can access with this phrase are determined by the <a href="https://medium.com/myetherwallet/hd-wallets-and-derivation-paths-explained-865a643c7bf2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“derivation path”</a>.</li>
<li>Example 12-words:<br><code>brain surround have swap horror body response double fire dumb bring hazard</code></li>
<li>Example 24-words:<br><code>card enrich gesture connect kick topple fan body blind engine lemon swarm venue praise addict agent unaware equal bean sing govern income link leg</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Hardware-Wallet"><a href="#Hardware-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Wallet"></a><strong>Hardware Wallet</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Typically, a device that “holds” your private key(s), ensuring these keys are safe.</li>
<li>They generally use a 24-word phrase. This phrase you should write down on paper (not on your computer) and store separately from your hardware wallet, in multiple locations.</li>
<li>If you lose your hardware wallet, you can still gain access to your accounts &amp; funds via the mnemonic phrase you wrote down.</li>
<li><strong>Never type the recovery phrase on your computer.</strong> It defeats the purpose of your hardware wallet.</li>
<li>See <a href="/en/hardware-wallets/using-ledger-with-mew/">here</a> for more information about Hardware Wallets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Address-Identicon-Address-Icon"><a href="#Address-Identicon-Address-Icon" class="headerlink" title="Address Identicon / Address Icon"></a><strong>Address Identicon / Address Icon</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The colorful blob of colors that corresponds to your address.</li>
<li>It is an easy way to see if your address is correct.</li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/lHUrIiZ.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Example 1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/FvyLewS.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Example 2</a></li>
<li>Note: The above addresses are a single character different but have remarkably different icons &amp; colors. Even one difference in character will result in a completely separate wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Hexadecimal"><a href="#Hexadecimal" class="headerlink" title="Hexadecimal"></a><strong>Hexadecimal</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Used all over Ethereum for a variety of things, a hexadecimal string is comprised of the numbers <code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code> and <code>A B C D E F</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Seed"><a href="#Seed" class="headerlink" title="Seed"></a><strong>Seed</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The input given to derive a private key. </li>
<li>Some use this as another way of saying ‘Recovery Phrase’ or ‘Mnemonic Phrase’.</li>
<li>This should always be generated in a truly random way, not something you make up with your brain.</li>
<li>If you chose the seed, it is known as a brain wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Brain-Wallet"><a href="#Brain-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Brain Wallet"></a><strong>Brain Wallet</strong></h2><ul>
<li>An account generated from a seed / password / passphrase of your choosing.</li>
<li>Humans are not capable of generating enough entropy, so the wallets derived from these phrases are insecure.</li>
<li>Brain wallets can generally be brute-forced easily by super fast computers.</li>
<li><em>Don’t use brain wallets.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Entropy"><a href="#Entropy" class="headerlink" title="Entropy"></a><strong>Entropy</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Also known as “randomness”.</li>
<li>The more random something is, the more entropy it has, and the more secure it is.</li>
<li>Usually defined in “bits of entropy”, or the number of years it would take to brute-force a ____ (i.e. private key) derived with that much entropy.</li>
<li>Ethereum private keys are 256-bit keys</li>
<li>24-Word mnemonic phrases are also 256 bits of entropy. 2048 words in the dictionary. 11 bits of entropy (the words). <code>11 * 24 = 264</code>. The last word is a checksum (read more about checksum <a href="/en/common-issues/not-checksummed/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Derive-Derivation"><a href="#Derive-Derivation" class="headerlink" title="Derive / Derivation"></a><strong>Derive / Derivation</strong></h2><ul>
<li>To derive something is to obtain it from an original source.</li>
<li>For example, if we were to derive a Keystore from a private key and a password, this means that the Keystore is made from these two sources.</li>
<li>The Keystore is a product of the two, thus it is derived from them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Encryption"><a href="#Encryption" class="headerlink" title="Encryption"></a><strong>Encryption</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Encryption is the act of taking a string of letters/numbers, like your private key, and turning them into another string of letters/numbers through a method of private translation.</li>
<li>There are various different encryption methods.</li>
<li>Encryption offers protection against those trying to steal your information!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Encrypted-vs-Unencrypted-Keys"><a href="#Encrypted-vs-Unencrypted-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Encrypted vs Unencrypted Keys"></a><strong>Encrypted vs Unencrypted Keys</strong></h2><ul>
<li>An unencrypted private key is 64 characters long, and it is used to restore wallets.</li>
<li>An encrypted key is also 64 letters long and is a regular private key that has gone through the process of encryption, as defined above.</li>
<li>Example: If the world ‘Apple’ was your shortened private key, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new shortened encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’. Since you know the way to encrypt this key, you could derive the original private key from it by reversing the method of encryption.</li>
<li>Usually, encrypted private keys are kept within the extension or device they are encrypted by, and they remain out of sight from the user. This is meant to add another layer of security to keep a user’s wallet information safe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Decentralize-Decentralization"><a href="#Decentralize-Decentralization" class="headerlink" title="Decentralize / Decentralization"></a><strong>Decentralize / Decentralization</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The process of transferring authority from a single entity (ex. Government or large corporation) to multiple smaller entities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Smart-Contracts"><a href="#Smart-Contracts" class="headerlink" title="Smart Contracts"></a><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A piece of code (or program) that is stored on the blockchain network.</li>
<li>Conditions of the contract are predefined by the users, if all conditions are met, certain actions are executed by the contract (program).</li>
<li>Read more about smart contracts <a href="/en/diving-deeper/what-is-a-smart-contract/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Blockchain"><a href="#Blockchain" class="headerlink" title="Blockchain"></a><strong>Blockchain</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A decentralized, publicly-owned ledger.</li>
<li>Immutable, unable to be edited, permanent.</li>
<li>Maintained by remote miners all over the world.</li>
</ul>

<li>Open-source means anyone can view, copy, or make suggestions to our code on <a href="https://github.com/MyEtherWallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Client-side means we do not have behind-the-scenes servers.</li>

<h2 id="Where-are-my-funds-stored-then"><a href="#Where-are-my-funds-stored-then" class="headerlink" title="Where are my funds stored then?"></a><strong>Where are my funds stored then?</strong></h2><ul>
<li>All ETH and tokens are stored on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
<li>When using any site, exchange, hardware wallet, or interface based on the blockchain, all crypto is stored on the blockchain itself. These platforms and hardware wallets just allow us to interact with the blockchain in a simplified way.</li>
<li>The Ethereum blockchain is not owned by a centralized entity, but is verified and maintained by thousands of remote people called ‘miners’ who use their time and energy to keep it all in check.</li>
<li>This is why our site, and sites like <a href="https://etherscan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a> and <a href="https://ethplorer.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethplorer</a>, are able to pull your wallet information. Not because of behind-the-scenes servers, but because they are pulling information from the blockchain itself. </li>

Users of most hardwares wallets do not receive their private key, but instead receive a 24-word mnemonic phrase for recovery purposes. The devices are also usually accompanied by a pin code or password used to unlock the device, and all information about each wallet is kept on the actual physical device itself. </p>
<p>To learn more about accessing MEW with hardware wallets, reference our <a href="/en/hardware-wallets/">Migrating to/from MEW</a> category.</p>

<h2 id="MEW-wallet"><a href="#MEW-wallet" class="headerlink" title="MEW wallet"></a><strong>MEW wallet</strong></h2><p>This is our fully fledged MEW mobile app for iOS and Android smartphones. It’s simple, fast, and secure to use. When creating a wallet with MEW wallet, your private key is kept encrypted on a secure, local vault in your phone. For backup, you are given a mnemonic phrase (much like the hardware wallets above). The wallet is also accompanied by a pin or password, which is used to unlock it on your device.</p>
<p>To learn more about accessing MEW with MEW wallet, reference our <a href="/en/mewwallet/mewwallet-user-guide/">MEW wallet User Guide</a>. </p>

<p>These wallets each have their own connection processes, but it always boils down to the same action- scanning a QR code with your app to connect to MEW. </p>

It offers all the functionality of the web-version of MEW in the convenience of an toolbar extension. It also hosts the ability to interact with web-based Dapps, such as CryptoKitties.</p>
<p>MEW CX will come in conflict with any other Web3 wallets you have, such as MetaMask or Brave Browser’s in-house wallet. Make sure all other Web3 wallets are disabled before using MEW CX.</p>
<h2 id="To-connect-MEW-with-MEW-CX"><a href="#To-connect-MEW-with-MEW-CX" class="headerlink" title="To connect MEW with MEW CX"></a><strong>To connect MEW with MEW CX</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install the MEW CX wallet via our Chrome Extension.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Open the extension and select ‘Add Wallet’ to create a new wallet or add an existing one.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you’ve saved a wallet, head to the MEW website. On the front page, select ‘Access My Wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Select the ‘Browser Extension’ option to connect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Read and accept the ‘Terms and Conditions’, then select ‘Access My Wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Confirm which wallet you’d like to connect with in the MEW CX pop-up window, or select ‘Burner Account’ for a temporary wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> You’re done!</p>
<h2 id="MetaMask"><a href="#MetaMask" class="headerlink" title="MetaMask"></a><strong>MetaMask</strong></h2><p>This is a Chrome Extension that allows the creation of an ethereum-based wallet that keeps one’s private key encrypted within the extension itself. It also generates a 12-word mnemonic phrase for recovery purposes. MetaMask allows users to name their separate wallets, see funds within the extension, and offers the option to import the private key information of a previously created wallet, if desired. </p>

This key is encrypted with a chosen password by the user. As such, it is impossible to change the password for these files. The only way to change the password is to make a completely new Keystore file, which can be achieved in our MEW Chrome Extension with one’s private key. Keystore files should not be opened. They are only to be utilized when accessing the Keystore/JSON option on our site and when prompted for one’s ‘JSON file’. You can read more about the functionality of a Keystore/JSON file <a href="/en/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-keystore-file/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Mnemonic-Phrase-Extra-Word"><a href="#Mnemonic-Phrase-Extra-Word" class="headerlink" title="Mnemonic Phrase (+ Extra Word)"></a><strong>Mnemonic Phrase (+ Extra Word)</strong></h2><p>This is a list of 12 to 24 words that are generated and given to users upon certain forms of wallet creation (i.e. MEWconnect, MetaMask, Hardware Wallets, JAXX wallets, etc.). Sometimes these phrases have an extra word associated with them, and sometimes they do not. The order and spelling of the words in a mnemonic phrase is directly tied to one’s private key, and therefore is not recommended as a regular way to access a wallet. It is best to only use this phrase for recovery purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Choose the ‘Software’ option to connect, then select ‘Mnemonic Phrase’ and click ‘Continue’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose whether it was a 12 or 24 word phrase, then fill out the form. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Enter your extra word (leave this blank if you’re using a MEWconnect phrase), and click ‘Unlock wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Choose your wallet’s address amongst the list generated, and you’re done!</p>
<h2 id="Private-Key"><a href="#Private-Key" class="headerlink" title="Private Key"></a><strong>Private Key</strong></h2><p>The private key is a string of 64 characters tied permanently to a public address. This is sometimes given to users when wallets are created and sometimes kept encrypted (in the case of MEWconnect, MetaMask, and Hardware Wallets). <em>Using one’s private key should always be a last-ditch effort of access, only to be utilized when all else fails.</em> This should not be the main method of entry for anyone to access their wallets. Private keys are the number one most sensitive information anyone can have for a wallet, because private keys allow immediate access and can never be changed. Therefore, it is extremely important to keep this safe, secure, and secret.</p>

<p>If you are getting an error message saying ‘Window Blocked’ when using a Trezor, Ledger, or MetaMask to confirm a transaction, this is because you are blocking pop-ups with the browser. </p>
<p>To fix this issue, you will need to ‘Allow Pop-Ups’ for MyEtherWallet.com.</p>
<p>This allows information to safely be sent to your device/extension so that the transaction can be signed and safely sent via our infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click ‘Create a New Wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose the ‘By JSON File’ option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Enter a <strong><em>strong</em></strong> password, and write it down on paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>We cannot recover or reset your password for you. Write it down!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Download your JSON File, preferably to a USB device. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click ‘Create a New Wallet’.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Choose a 12 or 24 word phrase, and WRITE IT DOWN!</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not store this on your computer. It is meant to be written down multiple times.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> There is an option for an extra word here, for added security. Choosing to include an extra word keeps your phrase more secure, but it limits the accessibility of your phrase with other wallets. Other wallets may not allow for an extra word, making your phrase incompatible.</p>
<ul>
<li>We cannot recover or reset your phrase or extra word for you. Write it down!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Now pass a quick test, and you’re done! You’re ready to access your wallet.</p>

<p>BC Vault Hardware Wallets are leading wallets for their security and interface usability standards. They are available for purchase <a href="https://bc-vault.com/?wpam_id=53" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. </p>
<p><em>Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</em></p>
<p>Hardware wallets often support multiple cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>
<p><strong>This part is very important.</strong> Your BC Vault device comes as its own SEPARATE wallet. You should not import your old MEW address into this, or use your old wallet with it. It has its own private key, encrypted into the device itself. You will be choosing a new ethereum address on this device, and using it as your new main wallet.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s begin!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="The-Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#The-Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="The Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>The Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unbox your BC Vault! Plug it into your computer and download the <a href="https://bc-vault.com/#downloader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BC Vault Desktop Application</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>You may want to pin it to your taskbar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Open the BC Vault Desktop Application and look to your device. The first time you set-up your device, you will need to shake it to initialize the random number generation. Once you’re done, the device should connect. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> The BC Vault desktop application will take you through a set-up tutorial for your Global Password. Make sure you pay close attention to the information shown. A few key things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read extra tips. This is your money, and it’s your responsibility.</li>
<li>Nobody can recover or change this information for you, so you need to remember it. Write it down and store it somewhere safe. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once you’re done, you will see a screen to create your first wallet. Before you do that, head to the settings section in the top-right. Familiarize yourself with this section and change any settings for your comfort. You can also update your firmware here.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> It’s extremely important you back up your wallet through the Settings section. You can use an SD card or a series of QR codes, whichever you’re more comfortable with. Just don’t lose it!</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> When you’re ready, head back to the main screen and select ‘Add New Wallet’. Choose Ethereum, name it, and continue to set up your new wallet. </p>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> You’re done! You’ve now created a new wallet with BC Vault.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On MEW, select ‘Access My Wallet’ &gt; ‘Hardware’ &gt; ‘BC Vault’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will ask for a Global Password on the website and a Pin on the device. Enter your information to connect to your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Select the address you want to use with MEW.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong>  You should now be taken to a screen that shows your new wallet address on MEW. Great job! You’re officially using your new BC Vault hardware wallet! </p>

This can be achieved by accessing your old wallet through MEW wallet, MetaMask, Keystore file, or private key (however you usually did it before the BC Vault). From here, send your ETH and tokens to your new BC Vault address, ready to be accessed in a more secure fashion.</p>
<p>Please be advised ETH will be required for gas to move any tokens held in your old wallet. We recommend holding .01 ETH to cover 2 - 3 transactions.</p>

<p>Digital BitBox Hardware Wallets are leading wallets for their security and interface usability standards. They are available for purchase <a href="https://shiftcrypto.ch/?ref=mew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</em></p>
<p>Hardware wallets often support multiple cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s begin!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="The-Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#The-Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="The Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>The Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unbox your Digital BitBox! Plug it into your computer and download the <a href="https://shiftcrypto.ch/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital BitBox Desktop App</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may want to pin it to your taskbar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In the Digital BitBox Desktop App interface, select ‘Create a new wallet’. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Set up a password to access your Digital BitBox. Make it something that is very easy to remember for you. Write it down in a couple places. Remember it!! This is how you will unlock your wallet everytime you want to access it.  </p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This is one of the most important steps. To recover your device in the future, you will need both the SD card AND your choice of recovery password. Do not write this recovery password down on your computer, do not take a picture of the password. Make sure you write down your recovery password in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE IT. If you lose this password and the SD card it’s attached to, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency. We suggest using multiple pieces of paper to write this down. Again, do not write this password down on your computer. Use pen and paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you remove and take good care of that SD card! </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Great, your device is now ready! Now let’s figure out how to use it with MyEtherWallet.</p>

<h2 id="Using-Digital-BitBox-with-MEW"><a href="#Using-Digital-BitBox-with-MEW" class="headerlink" title="Using Digital BitBox with MEW"></a><strong>Using Digital BitBox with MEW</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Attach your Digital BitBox device and head to MyEtherWallet.com.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On MEW, select ‘Access My Wallet’ &gt; ‘Hardware’ &gt; ‘Digital BitBox’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will ask for a password. Enter your password to connect to your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> You will see a bunch of addresses here. Make sure you’re on the Ethereum network, using the standard Ethereum derivation path, and then choose your address.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no right or wrong choice for choosing an address, it’s up to you. But choosing the first one is usually the best practice, for convenience and memory’s sake.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong>  You should now be taken to a screen that looks very similar to your old wallet’s access screen. Great job! You’re officially using your new Digital BitBox hardware wallet! </p>

<p>CoolWallet Hardware Wallets are leading wallets for their sleek design, uncompromising security, and bluetooth capabilities. They are available for purchase <a href="https://www.coolwallet.io/product/coolwallet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. </p>
<p><em>Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</em></p>
<p>Hardware wallets often support multiple cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>
<p><strong>This part is very important.</strong> Your CoolWallet device comes as its own SEPARATE wallet. You should not import your old MEW address into this, or use your old wallet with it. It has its own private key, encrypted into the device itself. You will be choosing a new ethereum address on this device, and using it as your new main wallet.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s begin!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="The-Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#The-Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="The Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>The Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unbox your CoolWallet! Pull out your phone, make sure Bluetooth is turned on, and download the CoolWallet Mobile App, CoolBitX, by scanning the QR code from the CoolWallet tutorial, included with your device. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Turn on your device by pressing and holding the main button. You will be asked to pair your device. Open the mobile app to  connect the device.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t see it, try restarting the device, the app, or turning your bluetooth on and off again. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enter the pin you see on your CoolWallet device into the app, then press the button on your device. This will complete the pairing process. After you’re done, you can click ‘Create’ to create your wallet.  </p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This is one of the most important steps. To recover your device in the future, you will need this recovery phrase. The app lets you select a length of phrase, this is your choice. Do not write this recovery phrase down on your computer, do not take a picture of the phrase. Make sure you write down your recovery phrase in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE IT. If you lose this phrase, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency. We suggest using multiple pieces of paper to write this down. Again, do not write this phrase down on your computer. Use pen and paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is paper provided in the CoolWallet set-up box to write down this phrase.</li>
<li>CoolWallet gives their recovery phrase in numeric format instead of traditional words. For more information on why, <a href="https://help.coolwallet.io/article/73-why-is-the-seed-generated-from-coolwallet-s-in-numeric-format" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out their answer</a>. We recommend copying both the numbers and their word equivalents, just in case.</li>
<li>After you’re done, you’ll need to add up all the numbers in your phrase to verify it was written correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Great, your device is now ready! Now let’s figure out how to use it with MyEtherWallet.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Using-CoolWallet-with-MEW"><a href="#Using-CoolWallet-with-MEW" class="headerlink" title="Using CoolWallet with MEW"></a><strong>Using CoolWallet with MEW</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> In the CoolWallet mobile app, go into your settings and make sure you are allowing new pairings. Then head to our site, <a href="http://www.myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.myetherwallet.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On MEW, select ‘Access My Wallet’ &gt; ‘Hardware’ &gt; ‘CoolWallet’. It should ask for a pairing password.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the bluetooth on your computer is also turned on. You may need to manually pair it with your computer. This can be done with a pairing password generated from the CoolWallet device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> On your CoolWallet mobile app, select ‘Show Pairing Password’. This will generate a password to pair with MEW. Type this password in then close your app before continuing. Once you’re done, select ‘Unlock CoolWallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> You will see a bunch of addresses here. Feel free to choose your address.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no right or wrong choice for choosing an address, it’s up to you. But choosing the first one is usually the best practice, for convenience and memory’s sake.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong>  You should now be taken to a screen that shows your CoolWallet public address. Great job! You’re officially using your new CoolWallet hardware wallet! </p>

<h2 id="What-About-My-Old-Wallet"><a href="#What-About-My-Old-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="What About My Old Wallet???"></a><strong>What About My Old Wallet???</strong></h2><p>If you are coming from an old wallet and want your ETH and tokens on your new, secure CoolWallet address, you will need to send your funds to your new address through regular transactions. This can be achieved by accessing your old wallet through MEW wallet, MetaMask, Keystore file, or private key (however you usually did it before the CoolWallet). From here, send your ETH and tokens to your new CoolWallet address, ready to be accessed in a more secure fashion.</p>
<p>Please be advised ETH will be required for gas to move any tokens held in your old wallet. We recommend holding .01 ETH to cover 2 - 3 transactions.</p>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting"><a href="#Troubleshooting" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshooting"></a><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></h2><p>Most issues with the CoolWallet can be fixed by performing a hard refresh (using CTRL+F5), confirming that all the firmware is updated to its latest release, and turning Bluetooth on and off again. </p>

<p>When accessing a hardware wallet, you’re given the choice of which derivation path to use. Most of the time it’s best to use the default path for familiarity, since each path leads to a different set of addresses. However, there are occassions where a different path is necessary. We’ve included the ability to add custom derivation paths so you can connect to whichever path you’d like. To read more about Derivation Paths, check out our article <a href="https://medium.com/myetherwallet/hd-wallets-and-derivation-paths-explained-865a643c7bf2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to the MEW homepage and select ‘Access My Wallet’, then choose ‘Hardware Wallet’. </p>
<ul>
<li>This can also be done via Mnemonic Phrase access. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> After selecting your Hardware Wallet, a screen like the one below should appear. Click the small arrow to expand a larger list of Derivation Path options.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/custompath0.jpg" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose ‘Custom Path’ on the bottom-right and enter the details of the custom path you’d like to connect through.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/custompath1.jpg" width="70%">

<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/custompath2.jpg" width="70%">

<p><strong>You’re all set!</strong> After you’ve added your custom path, you should see a different list of addresses to connect to.</p>

<p>If you would like to use your Ledger hardware wallet with an android device, there are a couple things you will need to prepare in advance.</p>
<h2 id="Requirements"><a href="#Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Requirements"></a><strong>Requirements</strong></h2><ul>
<li><p>Modern android phone or tablet, supporting USB On-The-Go (USB-OTG).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re not sure of USB-OTG support, check it yourself using an app like the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faitaujapon.otg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USB-OTB Checker</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A USB-OTG adapter (found on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=usb+otg+adapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> for a couple bucks).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setting-Up-Your-Device"><a href="#Setting-Up-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up Your Device"></a><strong>Setting Up Your Device</strong></h2><p>Before connecting to your Ledger, you first have to install a <a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/android-u2f-bridge/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ledger application</a>. Click that URL on your Android device, and select the file <code>android-u2f-bridge-x.x.apk</code>. Once downloaded, open this file on your device and install it. Click ‘done’ when you are finished.</p>
<p>Now you can connect your Ledger hardware wallet and open the Ethereum app. Make sure ‘Contract Data’ is turned on. Now open your browser and head to MyEtherWallet.com. Under ‘Access My Wallet’, choose the ‘Hardware’ option and click ‘Ledger Wallet’ to connect to your device.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallets/ledger-hardware-wallet-using-with-android-01.png" width="50%">

<p>You should see this pop-up, asking to allow the app Ledger U2F to access the USB device. Select ‘OK’, and you will be connected to your Ledger!</p>

<p>KeepKey Hardware Wallets are leading wallets for their security and interface usability standards. They are available for purchase <a href="https://keepkey.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/keepkey-the-simple-bitcoin-hardware-wallet/?source=hasoffers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</em></p>
<p>Hardware wallets often support multiple cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>

<ul>
<li>It’s not a typical browser extension that shows on your browser like MetaMask. You may want to pin it to your taskbar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In the KeepKey Client interface, select ‘Initialize Device’. </p>
<ul>
<li>Set your label (name) for your device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Set up a PIN code to access your KeepKey. Make it something that is very easy to remember for you. Write it down in a couple places. Remember it!! This is how you will unlock your wallet everytime you want to access it. The PIN code must be between 4 and 8 characters. </p>
<ul>
<li>Keep them in the correct order, too!</li>
<li>The pin numbers will appear on the actual device itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This is one of the most important steps. Do not write this phrase down on your computer, do not take a picture of the phrase. Make sure you write down your 12 seed words in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE THEM. If you lose these words, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency.

<p>Ledger Hardware Wallets are some of the most secure and intuitive cryptocurrency hardware wallets out there. They are available for purchase <a href="https://www.ledger.com/?r=fa4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</em></p>
<p>This particular hardware wallet supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>
<p><strong>This part is very important.</strong> Your Ledger device comes as its own SEPARATE wallet. You should not import your old MEW address into this, or use your old wallet with it. It has its own private key, encrypted into the device itself. You will be choosing a new ethereum address on this device, and using it as your new main wallet.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="Using-Ledger-with-MEW"><a href="#Using-Ledger-with-MEW" class="headerlink" title="Using Ledger with MEW"></a><strong>Using Ledger with MEW</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Attach and unlock your Ledger device. You should see a few different sections to choose from, choose the Ethereum section as shown above. Click both buttons to open it.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/ethereum-app.jpg" width="50%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click into this Setting section with both buttons.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/ethereum-settings.jpg" width="50%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will see “Contract Data” in this section. Make sure this option is turned to “Yes”.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Good job, it’s all ready now! Head back to the “Ethereum” section and leave your Ledger alone for a moment. Let’s head to MEW!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Check the URL for the “MyEtherWallet Inc [US]” SSL certification to make sure you’re on our real, secure site. Are you? Great! Head to ‘Access My Wallet’ and choose the option that says ‘Hardware’. Click the ‘Ledger Wallet’ option, and choose ‘Connect With Your Device’ with your Ledger device still attached, unlocked, and ready.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/MEW1.png" width="75%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> A screen showing different networks and derivation paths should appear. Choose which network you’d like to connect to, and which path you’d like to use. For regular ETH usage, you should be on an ETH network, under the Ethereum derivation path. You can also access other networks, such as Ethereum Classic (ETC), by choosing the related network path. </p>

<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/Ledger1.png" width="70%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> You will see a list of addresses. These are your new addresses to choose from for your main wallet! Choose one out of the five that you like. (Most people choose the first one, but you don’t have to.)</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/Ledger2.png" width="41.3%"> <img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/Ledger3.png" width="50%"></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> You should now be taken to a screen that looks very similar to your old wallet’s access screen. Great job! You’re officially using your new Ledger hardware wallet! </p>

<h2 id="What-About-My-Old-Wallet"><a href="#What-About-My-Old-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="What About My Old Wallet???"></a><strong>What About My Old Wallet???</strong></h2><p>If you are coming from an old wallet and want your ETH and tokens on your new, secure Ledger address, you will need to send your funds to your new address through regular transactions. This can be achieved by accessing your old wallet through MEW wallet, MetaMask, Keystore file, or private key (however you usually did it before the Ledger). From here, send your ETH and tokens to your new Ledger address, ready to be accessed in a more secure fashion.</p>
<p>Please be advised ETH will be required for gas to move any tokens held in your old wallet. We recommend holding .01 ETH to cover 2 - 3 transactions.</p>

<p>Secalot Hardware Wallets are leading wallets for their security and interface usability standards. They are available for purchase <a href="https://www.secalot.com/product/secalot-dongle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</em></p>
<p>Hardware wallets often support multiple cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>
<p><strong>This part is very important.</strong> Your Secalot device comes as its own SEPARATE wallet. You should not import your old MEW address into this, or use your old wallet with it. It has its own private key, encrypted into the device itself. You will be choosing a new ethereum address on this device, and using it as your new main wallet.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s begin!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="The-Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#The-Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="The Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>The Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unbox your Secalot! Plug it into your computer and download the <a href="https://www.secalot.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secalot Control Panel application</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>You may want to pin it to your taskbar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In the Secalot Control Panel interface, select ‘Create wallet’ under the Ethereum section. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Set up a PIN code to access your Secalot. Make it something that is very easy to remember for you. Write it down in a couple places. Remember it!! This is how you will unlock your wallet everytime you want to access it. The PIN code must be between 4 and 8 characters. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This is one of the most important steps. Do not write this phrase down on your computer, do not take a picture of the phrase. Make sure you write down your 12 seed words in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE THEM. If you lose these words, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency. We suggest using multiple pieces of paper to write this down. Again, do not write this phrase down on your computer. Use pen and paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep them in the correct order, too!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Great, your device is now ready! Now let’s figure out how to use it with MyEtherWallet.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Using-Secalot-with-MEW"><a href="#Using-Secalot-with-MEW" class="headerlink" title="Using Secalot with MEW"></a><strong>Using Secalot with MEW</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Attach your Secalot device and head to MyEtherWallet.com.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On MEW, select ‘Access My Wallet’ &gt; ‘Hardware’ &gt; ‘Secalot’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will ask for a password. Enter your pin to connect to your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> You will see a bunch of addresses here. Make sure you’re on the Ethereum network, using the standard Ethereum derivation path, and then choose your address.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no right or wrong choice for choosing an address, it’s up to you. But choosing the first one is usually the best practice, for convenience and memory’s sake.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong>  You should now be taken to a screen that looks very similar to your old wallet’s access screen. Great job! You’re officially using your new Secalot hardware wallet! </p>

<h2 id="The-Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#The-Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="The Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>The Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unbox your Trezor! You will see some cards and instructions for set-up. Follow these instructions carefully! Plug in the Trezor to your computer and get started. Visit <a href="https://trezor.io/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trezor.io/start</a> to begin the process. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor1.jpg" width="35%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Choose ‘Create new’ on this page, and follow the steps to set up your new device.The first thing you will want to do is ‘Create a backup in 3 minutes.’ </p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor2.png" width="80%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> <em>This is one of the most important steps.</em> Do not write this phrase down on your computer, do not take a picture of the phrase. Make sure you write down your 24 seed words in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE THEM. If you lose these words, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency. Ledger provides cards for you to write them down for remembering, but I suggest writing them down in one extra place as well. Again, do not write this phrase down on your computer. Use pen and paper. When you’re done, you’ll see the screen below.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor3.png" width="80%">

<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor4.png" width="75%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Now you will be prompted to choose a name for your Trezor. This is the name you will see on your device whenever you plug it in. Choose something familiar and personal!</p>
<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor5.png" width="70%">

<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor6.png" width="75%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> You will now choose your pin. This pin will be the only way to access your device (besides the recovery phrase you wrote down, multiple times) so it’s very important to choose a secure, but easy to remember pin. Don’t just use <code>1111</code> or <code>1234</code>, use something a bit more random and secure.<br><em>Don’t make this mistake! If it says it could be safer, make it longer!</em></p>

<img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/MEW1.png" width="75%">

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> A screen will pop-up asking for you to allow MEW permissions to read the public keys from your Trezor device. Click ‘Allow once for this session’, and feel free to select ‘Don’t ask me again’, so this step is automatic in the future. Select ‘Export’ on the next screen, enter your pin, and you’ll be redirected back to MEW. </p>

<h2 id="In-short-the-answer-is-no-because-it-is-not-possible"><a href="#In-short-the-answer-is-no-because-it-is-not-possible" class="headerlink" title="In short, the answer is no because it is not possible."></a><strong>In short, the answer is no because it is not possible.</strong></h2><p>In fact, <strong>no Ethereum wallets store their keys in iPhone’s Secure Enclave</strong>. Some wallets will claim that they use a ‘Secure Enclave’, but what they really mean is just a ‘general secure location’ within the device. Apple has guidelines and restrictions in place that do not allow the use of their Secure Enclave technology for crypto purposes, intentional or not. This is for a variety of reasons.  </p>
<p>The first reason is <strong>lack of support</strong>. The Secure Enclave of iPhones is a separate piece of hardware disconnected from the rest of the phone. This hardware cannot be accessed, altered, backed up, or upgraded by anyone, including Apple. And the current framework of the Secure Enclave does not host the capabilities of generating Ethereum keypairs. Therefore, it is not possible for any companies to use this hardware as a method of generating and storing Ethereum keys. Future upgrades to the encryption algorithms used by the Secure Enclave may change this, but it’s not likely to happen soon and would only apply to all future devices. </p>
<p>Even if they started offering this support with future versions, the second issue makes it very unwise to implement. This is mainly due to one reason listed in particular, <strong>no back-up services</strong>. Currently, MEWconnect gives 24 words for recovery, should a user get a new phone or break their current one. However, the inaccessibility of Apple’s Secure Enclave technology makes it impossible to design a recovery process, making each wallet generated by this technology vulnerable to being lost forever. </p>
<p>Instead, MEWconnect uses a local, secure keychain to encrypt and store the private information tied to one’s wallet. This information never leaves the device, so connecting to MEW and sending transactions is still just as secure. We believe transparency and honesty are important, so these distinctions have to be made. </p>

<p>These random V2 JSON files always make things complex. We apologize in advance.</p>
<p>You need to convert it to the standard V3 (‘Keystore / UTC’) file. The easiest way is using geth.</p>
<p>Download <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the appropriate version of the geth</a> based on your operating system.</p>
<p>Once you download it, extract the zip. Also copy your V2 JSON file into the same folder.</p>
<p>There are really explicit instructions for PC and Mac users <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/465/How-to-import-a-plain-private-key-into-geth-or-mist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now you have to open a command line window and type in the following command:</p>
<p><code>geth account import nameofyourwalletfile</code></p>
<p>This will import your file into geth and convert it to the latest (V3) keystore file. </p>

<li>Mac: <code>~/Library/Ethereum</code></li>
<li>Linux: <code>~/.ethereum</code></li>
<li>Windows: <code>%APPDATA%\Ethereum</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Copy that file, and select it on <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEW</a>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>Moving foward, use this file. Keep a backup of it (and the old file, just in case).</p>

<p>You can use both MyEtherWallet (MEW) and Jaxx at the same time, as both are client-side wallets that allow access to the Ethereum blockchain. There is no need to ‘import’ or ‘sweep’ your ETH from your Jaxx wallet to a new wallet with MEW.</p>
<p>Instead, use your Jaxx 12-word mnemonic phrase to <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/">access your wallet</a>. You will derive multiple addresses, choose the one you are familiar with. Both ETH and ETC can be accessed via this address, as well as various other networks we support.</p>
<p>To access your ETC (or other networks), access your wallet and change your network in the upper-right hand corner of your wallet’s interface. We offer multiple nodes for ETC, so choose whichever is right for you. (Don’t overthink it.)</p>

<p>If you are like many of our other users, you may be wondering how this will affect your wallet. </p>
<p>Fear not! MyEtherWallet (MEW) is still going strong at our current site, <a href="www.myetherwallet.com">www.myetherwallet.com</a>.</p>
<p>Here you are able to access the same wallet you used on the Vintage version of our site, through the same method.</p>
<p>You do not need to create a new wallet to use the new MEW site, you can use the exact same wallet you had on Vintage.-</p>
<p><strong>First, select ‘Access My Wallet’ on the homepage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then choose your usual method of access.</strong> For example, if you used a Keystore/JSON file on vintage you’d select ‘Software’ and choose the ‘Keystore’ option to connect.</p>
<p><strong>After you’ve connected, you’ll be taken to your Wallet Dashboard page.</strong> Here you can view your balances, send transactions, interact with Dapps, swap your crypto, and even manage NFTs! </p>
<p>We’ve come a long way since our days in Vintage, so it’s a good idea to take a few minutes and explore our new features. </p>

<p>First, it’s important to tell <a href="/en/getting-started/difference-between-mew-and-exchange/">the difference between an exchange and MyEtherWallet (MEW)</a>. </p>
<h2 id="Let’s-review"><a href="#Let’s-review" class="headerlink" title="Let’s review:"></a><strong>Let’s review:</strong></h2><ul>
<li>MyEtherWallet (MEW) is not an exchange.</li>
<li>MEW does not hold your information or funds. </li>
<li>The user is in complete control of their security. This means:<ul>
<li>If you lose your private key, we cannot retrieve it. </li>
<li>If you forget your password, we cannot locate or reset it.</li>
<li>We cannot reverse or refund any transactions. </li>
<li>If you are phished, the only way for the attacker to get your information is through your own use. We never had it.</li>
<li>We cannot look up your attacker’s IP address or information.</li>
<li>We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are decentralized, meaning there are no central servers or powers to control everything. MEW is client-side and acts as a doorway to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. In the same way that a door does not know who’s using it, cannot restore accounts, and cannot hold funds, neither can we.</p>
<p>What we DO offer is freedom and a true sense of security. You gain complete control over your finances and information. You have the security of knowing that even if MEW shut down, you could still access your funds with a number of other decentralized ETH wallet platforms, or even directly on the blockchain itself. You are the only one with your information, and if MEW gets hacked, it won’t affect you. Because your funds and usage are not stored in MEW. They are on the blockchain, and you access them anonymously. </p>
<p>Once you’ve made the distinction, you’ll be ready to <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet/">create your MEW wallet</a>. Before you do that, though, we suggest you read through our <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-create-a-wallet/">‘Getting Started’</a> category. It contains all the knowledge you need to begin your crypto journey with confidence. </p>

<p>Many users use MetaMask for it’s ease of use and integration with many popular crypto sites, but they still want to have the functionality that MEW offers. For this reason, we offer support for MetaMask wallets right in our interface. Connecting is simple!</p>
<h2 id="Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><h4 id="Only-for-users-who-do-not-already-have-a-MetaMask-wallet-and-would-like-to-create-one"><a href="#Only-for-users-who-do-not-already-have-a-MetaMask-wallet-and-would-like-to-create-one" class="headerlink" title="Only for users who do not already have a MetaMask wallet and would like to create one."></a><em>Only for users who do not already have a MetaMask wallet and would like to create one.</em></h4><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Find and install the MetaMask extension in the Google Chrome store. </p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure it’s the legitimate extension.<br>Are there a lot of users and positive reviews? </li>
<li>Is it offered by MetaMask.io? </li>
<li>If all of the above is true, you’re likely on the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Create your wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to choose a difficult password and record it on physical paper, just in case.</li>
<li>Follow the steps carefully, and make sure you write down the 12-word recovery phrase offered by the extension. This will be the only form of recovery for your wallet. Keep it safe.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Log into MetaMask and familiarize yourself with your new wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take special note of your public address (0x..).</li>

<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Login to your MetaMask wallet via their Chrome Extension.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the MEW front page, select ‘Access My Wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Select the ‘Browser Extension’ option to connect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Read and accept the ‘Terms and Conditions’, then select ‘Access My Wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Confirm connection in the MetaMask pop-up window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> You’re done!</p>

<p>Just like with all Ethereum wallets, the process begins with the generation of your <strong>crypto wallet key</strong>. This key is the foundation of your wallet, offering complete and permanent access to your account and all the funds involved. We recognize the significance of your private key, so <strong>we encrypt it with a master key</strong>. But we don’t stop there.</p>
<p>Your encrypted key is <strong>encrypted again</strong> with an access key depending on the method of access you use to unlock your MEW wallet mobile account. MEW wallet offers a pin code and biometric signature, such as a FaceID or fingerprint, as access methods used in the encryption process. </p>
<p>But we’re not done yet. This is where the process changes slightly depending on if you’re using an iOS or Android mobile device.</p>
<p>To make sure your key is protected, this encrypted key is <strong>encrypted again</strong> with a key generated from the Android Keystore section of your device, or the Secure Enclave if you’re using an iOS device. This specific key is not shared with us or any other apps in your phone, it is completely isolated architecturally within the local hardware of your mobile phone. </p>
<p>After that, we store this <strong>super encrypted key</strong> in a local SharedPreferences storage for Android devices, or the local KeyStore storage on iOS, which are also separated from the rest of the system on the software level.</p>
<p>This process may seem like overkill, but it’s necessary for the security of your information. When you make a new wallet with our MEW wallet app, you can rest assured that no one has access to your private key.</p>
<p>In fact, we don’t even allow our users to see their key. Instead, we offer a 24-word recovery phrase for backing up your accounts. This is generally viewed as the best method of recovery, which is used by most hardware wallets and wallet interfaces. </p>
<p>It’s recommended that you keep this phrase written down on paper, off of the internet, and stored in multiple physical locations. We cannot recover this information for you, which is a good thing. It means you have all the power and control over your accounts.</p>

<p><strong>This is for the security of your wallet. Your private key should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>MEW wallet utilizes <a href="/en/mewwallet/mewwallet-security/"><strong>multi-layer encryption and isolation</strong></a> to keep your keys safely stored away locally in your device. Your keys are heavily encrypted and completely separate from the outside world. </p>
<p>That means <strong>no one</strong> has access to them, including you. </p>
<p>Instead, the MEW wallet app offers a <a href="/en/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase/"><strong>24-word recovery phrase</strong></a> to back up and restore your wallet. This phrase acts similarly to a private key, so it’s important to keep it written down on paper and stored in a physical location. </p>
<p>Don’t type your phrase into a word doc. Write it down with a pen!</p>

<p>It’s always considered the best practice to keep your private key off the internet. There are rare cases where a private key is necessary to perform a specific task, like to claim tokens from a specific wallet, but most of the time the compromising nature of exposing your key doesn’t make the task worth it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Follow this link and check if your network type is already present. If not, you will need to prepare a few pieces of information about your network, such as the name, symbol, homepage, blockExplorer, and chainID.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> If you don’t see your network in the list, click ‘Create new file’ in the top-right corner of GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Name your folder the same name as the network you’re adding. </p>
<ul>
<li>Example using CLO: ‘CLO.js’</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Fill in your network type information with the format below, using CLO as an example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change all the references to CLO with the appropriate information for your network.</li>
<li>If you need to import tokens and contracts, you may first need to add those to the Ethereum-lists repo, found here: <a href="https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/tree/master/src" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/tree/master/src</a> </li>

<li>It’s a good idea to keep most of your naming and linking in all lower-case, except for the naming of your Types folder (which you’ve already done in Step 3). </li>

<p>Have you accidentally sent ETC to your ETH address? Are you curious to try ETH, but want to fool around on the Ropsten test network first?

<ul>
<li>We do not recommend using a Keystore File/Mnemonic Phrase/Private Key to access your funds.

</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your wallet’s overview page, you will see a ‘Network’ section in the upper right hand corner. Click the ‘Change’ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose the network you would like to interact with from this list. Your address will not change, but your funds will change to reflect the selected network. </p>

<ul>
<li>You will notice there are separate derivation paths for ETC and ETH. You do not have to change to the ETC path in order to access your ETC. Changing the derivation path will produce a different list of Ethereum addresses than you may be used to seeing.

<p>The first thing to understand is that MyEtherWallet (MEW) does not ‘create’ any private keys or public addresses. MEW (and other ETH wallet services) randomly generate private key/public address pairings for a user when ‘creating a new wallet’. </p>
<p>Every ETH address begins with ‘0x’ and is followed by 40 hexadecimal characters, for a total of 42 characters. Hexadecimal characters can be any character between the ranges of ‘a - f’ and ‘0 - 9’.  This means there are <code>16^40</code> possible ETH addresses, which is the same as <code>2^160</code> possible addresses. </p>
<p>That means there are <code>1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976</code> possible addresses to choose from. </p>
<p>Keys are not ‘picked’, though. The reason randomizing this process is so crucial is because our brains are flawed. We are not capable of achieving true randomization with our choices. If you choose your own private key, you will have access to a wallet of your choice. However, if someone else also picks that private key, all of your information and funds will be at their mercy. So we let technology generate these addresses for us, for true entropic generation.</p>
<p>To put all of this in perspective, there are approximately <code>7.5 x 10^18</code> grains of sand on Earth. That’s</p>
<p><code>7,500,000,000,000,000,000</code> grains of sand</p>
<p>compared to</p>
<p><code>1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976</code> addresses</p>
<p>That’s quite a difference. In fact, this number is so mind-blowingly big that, at one address per second, it would still take longer than the galaxy has existed (~13.21 billion years) to even make a tiny dent – and you would still be unlikely to run across an address with any activity on it! Not only that, but it would take more energy than the Sun can offer to even try and brute-force any specific address.  </p>
<p>The estimated age of the Universe itself is <code>~4.32 x 10^17</code> seconds old. In order to use up even half of the possible addresses in that amount of time, you would need to generate around <code>1.6 x 10^31</code> addresses every second. That’s 16 nonillion addresses every second, since the dawn of the Universe. And that’s just to use up half of them!</p>
<p>Even if the blockchain is vigorously active for the next ten thousand years, the chances of receiving a duplicate address are basically zero.</p>

<p>For increased security, you can run MyEtherWallet (MEW) on your local computer, instead of from the GitHub servers through our website. The main computer being used to generate the transactions should not be connected to the internet. You can generate a wallet completely offline and send transactions on a different computer, which must be connected to the internet, from our ‘Send Offline’ section. In this way, your sensitive information (i.e. private key, keystore file, mnemonic phrase) is kept on an offline device, and it is never transmitted off your device.</p>
<p>There are two ways to use MEW offline, through the use of PWA or by downloading the client.</p>
<h2 id="Using-MEW-Offline-as-a-Progressive-Web-App-PWA"><a href="#Using-MEW-Offline-as-a-Progressive-Web-App-PWA" class="headerlink" title="Using MEW Offline as a Progressive Web App (PWA)"></a><strong>Using MEW Offline as a Progressive Web App (PWA)</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> In order to use MEW as a PWA, you’ll first need to head to our website on Google Chrome and install MEW. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline1pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your <strong>online</strong> computer, scroll down to the footer to find our Offline Helper tool.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline2pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enter the address you’re sending <strong>from</strong> and click ‘Export JSON File’. </p>
<ul>
<li>Keep this safe, you’ll need it momentarily on your offline computer. Export it onto a USB for easy transfer.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline3pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> On your <strong>offline</strong> computer, access your wallet as you would normally.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will look a bit strange, since you’re offline.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline4pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> To the left, select ‘Send Offline’.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline5pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Scroll down and import the JSON file you received earlier. This will fill in a few details. After that, paste the address you’re sending <strong>to</strong> and the amount you’d like to send.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline6pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Now select ‘Generate Transaction’ and download the JSON file, or copy the Signed Transaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to use the USB from before for this step as well.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline7pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> Back to your <strong>online</strong> computer, head to the Offline Helper tool again and enter the Signed Transaction section. </p>
<ul>
<li>Upload the JSON file here, or paste the Signed Transaction, then press ‘Continue’. Details should generate in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline8pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> Double-check all your transaction details, then click ‘Send’. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline9pwa.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 10.</strong> You’re done! You’ve just sent an offline transaction.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/offline10pwa.png" width="80%">

<h2 id="Downloading-and-Running-MEW-Offline"><a href="#Downloading-and-Running-MEW-Offline" class="headerlink" title="Downloading and Running MEW Offline"></a><strong>Downloading and Running MEW Offline</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> In order to set up your local MEW, start by <a href="https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloading the latest release of MEW</a>.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/MEWoffline1.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click on <code>MyEtherWallet-vX.X.X.X.zip</code> to download the file. Move this file to a USB stick (or another storage transfer device), and transfer it to your permanently-offline computer.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/MEWoffline2.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Plug the USB into your offline computer and extract all the files into the archive of the computer. Extracting the files is important, otherwise MEW will not open correctly and will look like a bunch of nonsense. You should end up with a folder containing these files: </p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/MEWoffline3.png" width="80%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> To open MEW, double-click the ‘index.html’ file. This will open MEW in your browser. You will get a warning saying it is unable to connect to the network, which is normal. You’re not connected to the internet. You won’t be able to see your ETH or token balances because of this, but these are viewable in a secure, public way by using an Ethereum blockchain explorer such as etherscan.io or ethplorer.io.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/offline/MEWoffline4.png" width="80%">

<p>Congratulations, you’re running MEW offline! Make sure to repeat this process periodically, to ensure you’re on the most up-to-date version of our interface.</p>

This is an extra word of your own choosing tacked onto the end of your phrase. For example, if you’re making a 24 word mnemonic phrase, this will act as a <strong>mandatory</strong> 25th word every time you want to use this phrase.</p>
<p>Occasionally, this extra word is also referred to as a ‘password’, but this is misleading. It’s actually a 13th / 25th word to your phrase.</p>
<p><strong>The upside to this is extra security.</strong> If someone got a hold of your 24 word mnemonic phrase, they would still need your extra word to act as a 25th word in order to access your funds. This greatly increases the security of your phrase. </p>
<p><strong>The downside to this is integration with other platforms.</strong> Almost every other Ethereum wallet interface requires your mnemonic phrase to be in a 12 or 24-word format and does not offer the extra word option. Therefore, restoring this phrase through other Ethereum wallets can prove difficult. This extra word becomes necessary to see your wallet, so you will not be able to regain access through non-supporting wallets. </p>
<p>In the end, the choice is yours.</p>
<h2 id="Accessing-or-Restoring-a-Wallet"><a href="#Accessing-or-Restoring-a-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Accessing or Restoring a Wallet"></a><strong>Accessing or Restoring a Wallet</strong></h2><h4 id="We-do-not-suggest-accessing-or-restoring-your-wallet-with-your-mnemonic-phrase-directly-on-our-website-unless-you-are-using-MEW-offline"><a href="#We-do-not-suggest-accessing-or-restoring-your-wallet-with-your-mnemonic-phrase-directly-on-our-website-unless-you-are-using-MEW-offline" class="headerlink" title="We do not suggest accessing or restoring your wallet with your mnemonic phrase directly on our website, unless you are using MEW offline."></a><strong>We do not suggest accessing or restoring your wallet with your mnemonic phrase directly on our website, unless you are <a href="/en/offline/using-mew-offline">using MEW offline</a>.</strong></h4><p>When accessing or restoring your wallet through the ‘Mnemonic Phrase’ option on MEW, you are given the choice of whether or not to include an extra word. Most of the time, the answer is no. </p>
<p>Most apps or extensions that use Mnemonic phrases, such as MEWconnect, MetaMask, and hardware wallets, do not include an extra word in their mnemonic phrase. They ask you to input a password for app access, but this is different than requiring an extra word for recovery purposes.</p>
<p>If you made your wallet directly on MyEtherWallet.com, you may need to use the extra word you chose during creation to restore your wallet. However, most wallets made through other platforms will <strong>not</strong> require the extra word. Simply toggle this option to the ‘off’ position and proceed with your recovery process.</p>

<p>MyEtherWallet does not manage accounts with information such as passwords, private keys, or emails. In order to ensure your security and privacy, no sensitive data is ever saved, stored, or transmitted when you use MyEtherWallet. We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain. We do not have servers and we do not hold your assets.</p>
<p>Only users themselves can access and control their funds – this is the purpose of decentralized networks. Your funds are stored on the Ethereum blockchain itself, and we are simply an interface that allows you to easily interact with them. Passwords and private keys are in the users’ hands and are the users’ responsibility.</p>

<p>If you are <a href="/en/offline/using-mew-offline/">using MyEtherWallet (MEW) offline and locally</a>, it is not possible to send transactions directly from the offline computer. To send or broadcast a transaction, an internet connection is required. To do this, you should use a second computer that is connected to the internet. This has the advantage of keeping your private key on a separate offline device that won’t be afflicted by malware or hackers. </p>
<h2 id="Find-the-Nonce-amp-Transaction-Details"><a href="#Find-the-Nonce-amp-Transaction-Details" class="headerlink" title="Find the Nonce &amp; Transaction Details"></a><strong>Find the Nonce &amp; Transaction Details</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to MyEtherWallet.com on your <strong>online</strong> computer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> At the bottom, in the footer, choose the ‘Send Offline Helper’ tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose the network you are interacting with. </p>
<ul>
<li>Leave it on ‘ETH’ if you are using Ether or ERC20 tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Fill in the address you are sending from, and our interface will generate a gas price and nonce for your transaction, along with other details</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Make a note of your nonce, export the JSON file, and move this file onto a USB.</p>
<h2 id="Generate-Your-Offline-Transaction"><a href="#Generate-Your-Offline-Transaction" class="headerlink" title="Generate Your Offline Transaction"></a><strong>Generate Your Offline Transaction</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Plug in the USB to your <strong>offline</strong> computer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Access the offline version of MEW on this same offline device. </p>
<ul>
<li>This is done by opening ‘Index’ from the file list with your browser.</li>
<li>If you do not have MEW downloaded for offline use, <a href="/en/offline/using-mew-offline/">this article will help you download the MEW web interface</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Access your wallet like you would normally, and choose ‘Send Offline’ from the menu to the left.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to use the ‘Send Offline’ tab instead of the regular Transaction tab, because the ‘Send Offline’ interface allows you to select any token for sending. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Import your JSON file from the connected USB. </p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, you can manually fill in your nonce, transaction details, and the address you are sending to, as well as other relevant data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> If you’re sending to a contract, extra data may cause you to need a higher gas limit. </p>
<ul>
<li>Excess gas will be refunded, so don’t be afraid to raise it as high as 100,000.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Click ‘Generate Transaction’, then copy the long string that says ‘Signed Transaction’ and paste it in a text file, or download a new JSON file holding your signed transaction’s details. Drag this text file or JSON file into your USB for the final step in the process.</p>
<h2 id="Sign-and-Send-Your-Transaction"><a href="#Sign-and-Send-Your-Transaction" class="headerlink" title="Sign and Send Your Transaction"></a><strong>Sign and Send Your Transaction</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to MyEtherWallet.com once more on your <strong>online</strong> computer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> At the bottom, in the footer, choose again the ‘Send Offline Helper’ tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Paste in your signed transaction, or import the new JSON file you just received, then press ‘Continue’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Review the details of your transaction then press ‘Send’.<br><br> </p>
<p>You’re done! Your transaction will show on an Ethereum blockchain explorer once it’s been verified. It can be searched using the transaction hash shown at the end of the process.</p>

<p>You may have noticed we have a disclaimer on our Keystore File, Mnemonic Phrase, and Private Key options for access. This disclaimer reads ‘This is NOT a recommended way of accessing a wallet.’ Why is that?</p>
<h2 id="Control-over-your-wallet"><a href="#Control-over-your-wallet" class="headerlink" title="Control over your wallet"></a><strong>Control over your wallet</strong></h2><p>Whether you’re using your private key, keystore file, or mnemonic phrase, each method is closely tied to one thing: your private key. This is what’s unlocking your familiar wallet, this unique key. If anyone gets their hands on this key, they will have full permanent control of your funds.</p>
<p>This means that if someone gets ahold of your mnemonic phrase or keystore file, they have full control over your wallet. Keystore files can have their passwords brute-forced relatively easily, if the password is weak enough. And Mnemonic phrases directly link to the same root private key, everytime.</p>
<p>This is why we do not recommend using these types of wallets, but instead use a wallet that keeps your key separate from the online world of peering eyes. MEWconnect, hardware wallets, and MetaMask are the most secure options we offer for access. </p>
<h2 id="Why-do-you-have-these-options-if-they-aren’t-recommended"><a href="#Why-do-you-have-these-options-if-they-aren’t-recommended" class="headerlink" title="Why do you have these options if they aren’t recommended?"></a><strong>Why do you have these options if they aren’t recommended?</strong></h2><p>At MEW, we believe that the blockchain and digital assets serve as instruments of financial freedom. As such, we believe that it is our responsibility, as a gateway to the ethereum blockchain, to give users the tools they need to protect themselves from scams, malicious actors, and human error while at the same time protecting the user’s right to choose. </p>
<p>MEW has taken strides to make sure that the most secure options for storing your keys are also the most convenient to use. We have also taken strides to ensure users are aware of the dangers of using non-recommended methods. However, should a user decide that employing a less convenient, high risk method of transacting it is likely because they feel that it is the method that best addresses their needs, and MEW honors their right to make that decision. </p>

<p>Be sure there is not a space at the beginning or end of your private key. We validate based on the number of characters. A private key has 64 characters, count to make sure you have all 64. If you saved another version (i.e. the UTC / Keystore file) it may also be worth trying that file as well. For more information about how to use a Keystore file, learn how to <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/">access your wallet</a>.</p>
<p>Please be sure that you are <strong>carefully and accurately</strong> typing your private key. A single wrong character will open a different wallet than is yours.</p>
<p>For reference private key looks like this:<br><code>afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890</code></p>

<p>MyEtherWallet (MEW) is a front-end interface that enables direct interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. Any Ethereum address (0x….) can hold both ETH and ERC20 tokens. MEW allows users to manage a variety of different funds on a single address.</p>
<p>Many exchanges will give separate addresses for separate tokens, but this is not necessary on MEW. Whether you store all your funds on one address or spread your crypto portfolio across multiple addresses is ultimately up to you. </p>
<p>Some users prefer to have their funds distributed across multiple addresses for the purposes of security, organization, or personal preference. Others find that keeping track of one wallet is easier. We suggest using whichever method best fits your needs.</p>
<p>However, remember that all Ethereum blockchain transactions require gas, which is always paid in ETH. We recommend having at least .01 ETH on all your addresses, for sending transactions when needed. Also, make sure to keep all your information organized. The more addresses you have, the easier it can be to lose track and forget essential details about your wallets.</p>

For more information on other methods of access, check out our article on <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/">how to access a wallet</a>.</strong></h4><h6 id="min-read"><a href="#min-read" class="headerlink" title=" min read"></a> min read</h6><hr>
<p>Your Keystore/JSON file holds an encrypted version of your private key, which is simply your private key encoded into a cool, secret string of characters. Take, for example, the word ‘apple’. If you encrypted this word with a 4-character difference down the alphabet, it would look something like ‘dssoh’. At face value, you’d have no idea what ‘dssoh’ meant. However, if you gave someone this word and told them the way you encrypted it, they could then decode it back to the world ‘apple’! This is a <strong>very</strong> simplified version of how encryption works, but it gets the point across.</p>
<p>When you enter your password upon generation of your wallet, it takes your password and uses it to encrypt your Private Key into a Keystore/JSON file. The result is a file that looks a lot like gibberish if you open it, (which there is no reason to do, do not open your JSON file!). This file simply holds your encrypted private key within it, which is why you have to use your chosen password to unlock your wallet via this method. You cannot change your password without generating an entirely new Keystore/JSON file.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the strength of your password is directly related to the integrity of your Keystore/JSON file. If you choose a weak password, and a hacker gets hold of your encrypted key, they can bruteforce it until they discover what password you used. Pick a strong password for a strong encryption! </p>
<h2 id="To-change-your-Keystore-JSON-file-password"><a href="#To-change-your-Keystore-JSON-file-password" class="headerlink" title="To change your Keystore/JSON file + password:"></a><strong>To change your Keystore/JSON file + password:</strong></h2><p>As mentioned above, you cannot change your password without generating a completely new JSON file. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install our <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myetherwallet/nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEW Chrome Extension</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In the extension, add a ‘new wallet’ by entering your private key. </p>
<ul>
<li>This does not mean generating an entirely new wallet. It means to add your existing wallet as a ‘new wallet’ into the extension.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enter a strong password, and save the wallet. </p>
<ul>
<li>This will be the new password for your JSON file, so choose wisely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Head to the ‘My Wallets’ area of the extension and click the word ‘Details’ in the top-right corner of your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Enter in the password you just made.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> You will be taken to an area that shows your wallet’s information. You can download a new Keystore/JSON file from this area, and use that for future access.</p>
<p>After downloading the new Keystore/JSON file, you can choose to continue using our Chrome Extension, or go back to using regular MEW. However, since you’re using a Keystore/JSON file, we highly suggest learning <a href="/en/offline/offline-mew-looks-weird/">how to use MEW offline</a>, for the security of your information.</p>

<p>Mnemonic phrases, also known as ‘seed words’ or ‘recovery phrases’, are ordered lists of 12 - 24 words which bring you to specific and unique wallet addresses. Each phrase leads to a near infinite amount of addresses, but most wallet interfaces pick the first one from the list to use as your public address. When you use a phrase on MEW web, you’ll see the first five addresses with the option to view more. If you’re using our MEW wallet app, each additional account you add is just the next address down the list of addresses that is generated from your phrase.</p>
<p>These phrases are typically used for recovery, and they are not meant to be used as the main method of access for anyone’s wallet. These phrases offer permanent and direct access to one’s wallet, so they should be treated carefully.</p>
<p>They can sometimes be paired with an extra word as well, for added encryption and security. When wallets offer this service, the extra word is used as an extra added word to the end of the phrase. For example, 12-word phrases become 13 words, and 24-word phrases become 25 words. MyEtherWallet offers this service, but MEW wallet does not. This means that mnemonic phrases generated directly on MEW’s website will have the option for an extra word at the end. But if you are restoring a MEWconnect recovery phrase on the web interface, you should leave the extra word field blank. </p>
<p>Mnemonic phrases are just as sensitive as your private key, in terms of privacy. With your phrase, anyone can permanently access your wallet. These phrases cannot be changed, so keeping them safe is crucial. </p>

<li>Make sure your spelling is 100% correct. Always double-check your work.</li>

<li>Think back to where you first created the wallet. Did the service require an extra word (13th or 25th word)?<ul>
<li>If it did, try entering your mnemonic phrase with the extra word you made.</li>
<li>If you already tried that, try entering the phrase leaving the extra word field blank.</li>

<p>Phishing and hacking are (unfortunately) very common in the crypto space. Don’t let it discourage you though, as most attacks are completely preventable. We will not be able to recover your funds for you, but we’re here to help however we can. Education is the biggest defense against these attacks. Being able to recognize and prepare yourself for future phishing attempts is very important. </p>
<h2 id="Step-1-Identify-the-method"><a href="#Step-1-Identify-the-method" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Identify the method."></a><strong>Step 1: Identify the method.</strong></h2><p>The first step is identifying how it happened. Phishers make their living by being sneaky, so being able to figure out their methodology will be tremendously helpful. </p>
<ul>
<li>Check your history. Have you recently visited any sketchy sites? Did you recently enter your information on a fake MEW after clicking a link? <ul>
<li>Look at the URLs. Do you see any tiny dots or accents over (or under) the letters?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scan your computer for malware. It’s possible your files have been compromised.</li>
<li>Do you have any remote-access software installed, i.e. Teamviewer? These can be hacked remotely to view the information right from your screen.</li>
<li>What method do you use to access your wallet? Private keys, keystore/JSON files, and mnemonic phrases are not generally recommended because they allow easy access to one’s wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Step-2-Make-a-new-wallet"><a href="#Step-2-Make-a-new-wallet" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Make a new wallet."></a><strong>Step 2: Make a new wallet.</strong></h2><p>Since your old wallet was compromised, you will need to discontinue its use and set up a new wallet. There are multiple safer options to choose from besides keystore/JSON files, mnemonic phrases, or private keys. </p>
<ul>
<li>The best thing you can do for your security is purchase a hardware wallet, such as the <a href="https://www.ledger.com/?r=fa4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ledger Nano S</a> or <a href="https://shop.trezor.io/?a=myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trezor</a>. These are generally around ~$100, but can save you thousands in the long run. </li>
<li><a href="/en/mewwallet/mewwallet-user-guide/">MEW wallet</a> is our fully fledged mobile app, which allows users to buy, hold, and send Ether and tokens right from their smartphone. It’s simple, fast, and secure.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaMask</a> is a free Google Chrome Extension that allows you to set up an Ethereum wallet, which can be used with MEW. MetaMask also warns you when visiting known phishing sites.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Step-3-Educate-yourself"><a href="#Step-3-Educate-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Educate yourself."></a><strong>Step 3: Educate yourself.</strong></h2><p>When it comes to crypto, there is no such thing as being too educated. This is a very new field, so even the experts have more to learn. The more you know, the more prepared you’ll be. </p>
<ul>
<li>A great place to start is with our <a href="https://kb.myetherwallet.com">Knowledge Base</a>. MEW maintains a variety of articles that can help. Start with our <a href="/en/security-and-privacy/pro-tips-how-to-avoid-phishing-scams/">Pro-Tips on how to avoid phishers</a>. </li>
<li>The force is strong with this community. Follow us on Twitter and Reddit for any current MEW-related scams or updates that might be going on.</li>
<li>Google everything! Before sending money to any service, search it on Google. Read people’s opinions on it, check Twitter and Reddit. Do your research!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Step-4-Let-the-world-know"><a href="#Step-4-Let-the-world-know" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Let the world know!"></a><strong>Step 4: Let the world know!</strong></h2><p>To avoid these scams, we need to know they’re happening. Take screenshots and write down what happened, while it’s still fresh.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send us the information! We cannot recover stolen funds, but we can help warn others. We’re always available at <a href="mailto:support@myetherwallet.com." target="_blank" rel="noopener">support@myetherwallet.com.</a> <ul>
<li>To make the process easier, make sure to include all relevant addresses, transaction hashes, screenshots, and details about how it happened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let people know on Twitter, Reddit, <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a>, etc. Blow up those comments. Let your voice be heard</li>
</ul>
<p>We know these attacks can be very demoralizing, but let it be an opportunity for learning. If these phishers deter you from using crypto, then they win. Show them that you’re a force to be reckoned with! </p>

<p>For instance, take a CryptoKitty. Each CryptoKitty is their own, separate NFT. No two NFTs are the same, even though they can represent similar things. </p>
<p>NFTs are very useful because they simulate real products and values that can be produced and transferred to prove ownership. They’re heavily used in blockchain gaming, where having unique items are treasured. </p>
<p>Since they’re built on the blockchain, their code and proof of ownership are immutable. You have full control over your NFTs, and no one can take that away from you. </p>

<p>Any ERC20 token can be added to your local MEW interface by following these instructions.</p>
<h2 id="Make-sure-it-isn’t-already-a-default-token"><a href="#Make-sure-it-isn’t-already-a-default-token" class="headerlink" title="Make sure it isn’t already a default token"></a><strong>Make sure it isn’t already a default token</strong></h2><p>First you’ll want to make sure your token isn’t already listed in our interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/">Access your wallet</a>. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom1.png" width="85%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Search our default token list for the token you are looking for.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see the token, but don’t see a balance, it’s possible our default listing is for a token with the same symbol but a different contract address. In this case, continue with these steps as if you didn’t see it in the list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> If you don’t see your token, continue with this article.</p>
<h2 id="Looking-for-the-token’s-information"><a href="#Looking-for-the-token’s-information" class="headerlink" title="Looking for the token’s information"></a><strong>Looking for the token’s information</strong></h2><p>You will need three pieces of information to add a custom token with our interface: the contract address, decimal count, and symbol. All of this information can be found via an Ethereum blockchain explorer, like Etherscan.io or Ethplorer.io. We will show how to find this via Etherscan.io.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a>. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom2.png" width="85%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> If you have a balance of the token you are trying to add, search for your public address (0x…) in the search bar. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a balance and would like to add the token before receiving it, search for the token in the search bar. Make sure you find the correct token, or you will be adding another token to your list.</li>
<li>There is no harm in sending your ERC20 token to your address before adding it as a custom token. In fact, this may make it easier to find via etherscan.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom3.png" width="60%">

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Find your token in the token balances dropdown. Select the token to be taken to a token information screen. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom4.png" width="85%">

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Here, you will find the token’s contract address and decimal count to the right of the interface. Remember the decimal count, and click on the contract address to be taken to the token’s main screen.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom5.png" width="70%">

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Copy this address to your clipboard, and head back to MEW. At the top of the token list, click ‘+ Custom Tokens’ to bring up the custom token addition screen. </p>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom6.png" width="50%">

<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Paste the contract address into the top field, input the token’s symbol (abbreviation) into the second field, and enter the decimal count last. Then click ‘Save’. You’re done!</p>
<h2 id="Common-Issues"><a href="#Common-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Common Issues"></a><strong>Common Issues</strong></h2><h4 id="“Token-Already-Exists-”"><a href="#“Token-Already-Exists-”" class="headerlink" title="“Token Already Exists!”"></a><em>“Token Already Exists!”</em></h4><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom7.png" width="50%">

<p>If you see this error, there is a simple fix for it. Re-enter your custom token information, but put a ‘2’ after the symbol. I.e. If the token’s symbol is ‘XYZ’, enter is as ‘XYZ2’.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom8.png" width="50%">

<p>If you still get this error after submitting it with the modified symbol, then your token is likely already a default token. Try searching the token list again for the symbol. If you see it with a balance of 0, but etherscan.io shows a balance, then you’ll likely need to change networks to another ETH node, in the upper right-hand corner. </p>
<h2 id="My-custom-tokens-are-disappearing"><a href="#My-custom-tokens-are-disappearing" class="headerlink" title="My custom tokens are disappearing!"></a><strong>My custom tokens are disappearing!</strong></h2><p>If your custom tokens are disappearing every time you access our interface, make sure that you do not have a cache-clearing software installed (i.e. CCleaner). Your custom token information is stored locally in your browser, so this software will clear this information and require you to re-submit the token every time you access your wallet. </p>
<h2 id="I’d-like-it-to-be-a-default-token"><a href="#I’d-like-it-to-be-a-default-token" class="headerlink" title="I’d like it to be a default token!"></a><strong>I’d like it to be a default token!</strong></h2><p>We are always happy to support new tokens in our default list.

<p>Lately, a lot of blockchain projects on Ethereum have been ‘airdropping’ tokens in the wallets of users. This is done to either spread the distribution of tokens, or to advertise the token to users.</p>
<p>The amount of airdropped tokens you receive depends (in a lot of airdrops) on how much Ether (ETH) you had at a specified block. Some airdrops drop the same amount of tokens to everyone.</p>
<p>That said, your Ethereum address is public on the blockchain, which means that anyone is able to send you ETH and/or tokens. If you want to find more information about airdropped tokens you received in your wallet, you can look them up on the internet for more information.</p>

<p>A ‘Token Already Exists’ error can occur when an incorrect contract address was added as a custom token. </p>
<p>To find the correct contract address, follow these instructions:</p>
<h2 id="Using-Ethplorer-io"><a href="#Using-Ethplorer-io" class="headerlink" title="Using Ethplorer.io"></a><strong>Using <a href="https://www.ethplorer.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethplorer.io</a></strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Enter the name of the token you want to add to your MyEtherWallet interface.</p>
<img src="/images/posts/common-issues/Ethplorer1Error.jpg" width="60%">

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the contract address (not the creator address) for the custom token field in MEW. Be sure to use the correct decimal count as well.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the contract address for the custom token and be sure to use the correct decimals as well.</p>

<h2 id="Other-causes"><a href="#Other-causes" class="headerlink" title="Other causes:"></a><strong>Other causes:</strong></h2><p>This error can also occur if the symbol of your token is the same as a symbol already in our default list. To solve this, try adding the symbol with a ‘2’ after. </p>
<p>Using our above example, instead of ‘SNT’, you would add the token as ‘SNT2’.</p>
<p>This has no actual effect on the token itself, but is just a placeholder to make organizing your tokens easier.</p>

<p>During times of normal volume, transactions are mined within seconds and do not spend any length of time in the transaction pool. There is simply not enough time to cancel or replace or override a transaction once it has been sent.</p>
<h2 id="However…"><a href="#However…" class="headerlink" title="However…"></a><strong>However…</strong></h2><p>During times of extremely high volume, transactions could be pending for hours, if not days, before being mined.</p>
<p>During these times it is theoretically possible to replace an existing transaction with a new transaction with a higher gas price.</p>
<p>The second transaction, theoretically, will be mined before the first transaction, effectively “canceling” the first transaction.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is by sending a <code>0 ETH</code> transaction to your own address with the same nonce and higher gas price. This will “cancel” your first transaction.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee this will work, nor that it will work every time. This tool is very, very new. Please use at your own risk.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Copy and paste the transaction hash into the search field provided.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Details will appear depending on the state of the transaction. It could be…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Success:</strong> Your transaction was successfully mined and is on the blockchain.    <ul>
<li>If you do not see any errors, your transaction was successfully sent. Your ETH or Tokens are where you sent them. If this balance has not been credited to your hosted wallet or exchange account 24 hours after sending, please contact that service. Send them the link to your transaction and ask them, nicely, to look into your situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Failed:</strong><ul>
<li>If you see a red ( ! ) symbol, or a “BAD INSTRUCTION” or “OUT OF GAS” error message, it means that the transaction was not successfully sent. You cannot cancel or replace this transaction. Instead, send a new transaction. If you received an “Out of Gas” error, you should double the gas limit you specified originally.</li>
<li>If you see ‘Reverted’, it’s a good idea to double-check the actions you’re taking. This is an error having to do with a smart contract user-error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Not Found:</strong> This transaction cannot be found. It’s possible that it did not go through, or that it cannot be found in the Ethereum blockchain explorer you are using. Try using the other one (Etherscan.io or Ethplorer.io). If you still can’t find it, it never went through.</li>
<li><strong>Pending:</strong> Your transaction was located in the transaction pool of the explorer you are using. It is currently pending (waiting to be mined). There is a chance you can cancel or replace this transaction, but it’s a very small chance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="“Replacing”-vs-“Canceling”-Transactions"><a href="#“Replacing”-vs-“Canceling”-Transactions" class="headerlink" title="“Replacing” vs “Canceling” Transactions"></a><strong>“Replacing” vs “Canceling” Transactions</strong></h2><ul>
<li><strong>Canceling:</strong> Generating a <code>0 ETH</code> transaction to your own address with the purpose of preventing a previous transaction from “going through” / “being mined” / being included in the blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>Replacing:</strong> Generating a <code>XX ETH</code> transaction to someon else’s address with the purpose of doing something (i.e. sending funds, revealing an ENS bid, etc.) while simultaneously not having a previous transaction go through.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason we recommend ‘Canceling’ over ‘Replacing’ is that it is not guaranteed your second transaction will actually replace your first one. Your first transaction could still be mined first, invalidating your second transaction. Choosing to replace a transaction with a new one could lead to more confusion, headaches, and pending ETH, or ETH spent unnecessarily in the form of gas. This is especially true if your first transaction is mined anyways, which is possible.</p>
<h2 id="Canceling-a-Transaction"><a href="#Canceling-a-Transaction" class="headerlink" title="Canceling a Transaction"></a><strong>Canceling a Transaction</strong></h2><p>Canceling means generating a <code>0 ETH</code> transaction to your own address with the purpose of preventing a previous transaction from “going through” / “being mined” / “being included in the blockchain” / “being stuck”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to Etherscan.io or Ethplorer.io.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Paste your transaction hash.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it says pending, you can still try to cancel it.</li>
<li>If it says not found, click the button again, waiting a few minutes between each click. If that doesn’t work, it’s likely your transaction never went through.</li>
<li>If it says success, you cannot try to cancel it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> If it says pending, access the wallet you used to send the original transaction on MEW.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Send a transaction to yourself with a balance of <code>0 ETH</code>. </p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Click the ‘Send Transaction’ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> A dialog will appear. Click the “Yes, I’m Sure” button to send.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> A new transaction hash will appear. Click the link to view it and see if you were successful. If it doesn’t show up immediately, try refreshing in a few minutes. </p>
<h2 id="Replacing-a-Transaction-Advanced-Users-Only"><a href="#Replacing-a-Transaction-Advanced-Users-Only" class="headerlink" title="Replacing a Transaction (Advanced Users Only)"></a><strong>Replacing a Transaction<br> (Advanced Users Only)</strong></h2><p>Replacing a transaction means generating a <code>XX ETH</code> transaction to someone else’s address with the purpose of doing something (i.e. sending a transaction, revealing an ENS bid, etc.) while simultaneously not having a previous transaction go through.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock the wallet you used to send the original transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Fill the ‘To Address’ field with whatever address you wish to send to.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Change the ‘Amount’ from <code>0</code> to the amount of ETH you wish to send.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> If sending a standard ETH transaction, you can use <code>21000</code> for the gas limit. If sending tokens, raise it to around <code>100000</code>. Otherwise, just leave as is.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> For the ‘Gas Price’ field, raise this to 10 GWEI higher than your previous transaction. If this is an urgent matter, then you may choose to raise it. Keep in mind, the higher the gas price, the higher the transaction fee (Gas Limit * Gas Price).</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Check and make sure the ‘Nonce’ field is the same as your previous transaction. If it is, leave the field as is. If you change this, it will not replace the transaction you are hoping it will replace.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Click the ‘Send Transaction’ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> A dialog will appear. Carefully review all information displayed. Click the “Yes, I’m Sure” button to send.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> A new transaction hash will appear. Click the link to view it and see if you were successful. If it doesn’t show up immediately, try waiting a few minutes then refreshing.</p>

<li>MEW does not receive any transaction fees. They are paid to the miners for including your transaction in a block. We are a free, open-source service.</li>
<li>The transaction pool varies from node to node. This means that a transaction may be pending in ETH (Infura.io)’s transaction pool, but not ETH (MyEtherWallet.com)’s transaction pool. For this reason, you should try all the ETH nodes we offer.</li>

<p>A successful transaction will look like <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcde5a30a1a1514919e9c357d4e89211701aa22a741936ad9516c2987d8b097c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>.</p>

<p>The lack of any red symbols or errors means that your transaction was successful! You can click on the ‘To:’ address on this transaction overview to redirect yourself to the funds destination. Make sure you double check the address to confirm it was 100% the same address you meant to send to. Even one wrong character will mean your funds were sent to another wallet’s address.</p>
<p>If you see an error on your transaction, this means it was not successful, and your funds never left their original wallet. You will need to try sending the transaction again, making a few changes to help it broadcast successfully. Depending on the error shown, it’s usually an easy fix. </p>

<p>If you are getting the error that looks like this: “Not enough ETH to send”, it means you do not have enough ETH in your account to cover the cost of gas.</p>
<p>Each transaction (including token and contract transactions) requires gas, and that gas is paid in ETH. You can think of this like a transaction fee.</p>

With tokens, the amount of gas is typically <code>50000 gas - 100000 gas</code>, so the total TX fee increases to <code>0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH</code>.</p>

<p>There is no minimum to transfer out of MyEtherWallet (MEW). We are not an exchange and have no way of blocking your withdrawals or deposits.</p>
<p>The only ‘minimum’ requirement is the minimum amount of gas needed to complete the transaction. For a standard transaction, that is <code>0.000441 ETH</code>.</p>
<p>If you have <code>0.000X ETH</code> in your account and want to empty your account completely, send <code>0.01 ETH</code> into the account and use the “Send Entire Balance” button to send the entire balance out. This will leave you with a balance of <code>0 ETH</code>.</p>

<p>This is a little easier to understand if you make the distinction that every wallet has two addresses. The first address is the ‘external’ or public address most people are familiar with (0x..), while the second can be considered an ‘internal’ address. All activity through the Ethereum blockchain starts with external addresses making some sort of action, but internal addresses are used behind-the-scenes with smart contracts to make small things happen. Whenever a smart contract needs to send ETH or make some sort of mechanic on its own, they call a function originally labeled as a ‘message,’ which eventually was renamed as an ‘internal transaction’. </p>
<p>This is a misnomer, because internal transactions are not actually considered transactions, as they are not included directly in the blockchain. Instead, they are more like a byproduct of smart contract functionality. Most importantly, they <strong>are</strong> reflected in the overall balance. They can usually be found under an ‘Internal Transaction’ tab, via <a href="https://www.etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan.io</a></p>

<p>Often times, a combination of new users, increased interest in Ethereum, games like CryptoKitties, and random ICOs can create quite a mess of the transaction pool, causing a lot of transactions to remain pending longer than usual. This is a network issue that affects all exchanges and ETH users.</p>
<p>There is simply not enough space in the blocks for the miners to mine all the transactions, and many systems are not currently set up to monitor the massive quantity of transaction requests. This is affecting all people’s ability to send transactions.</p>

<p>MyEtherWallet (MEW) makes it easy for you to send a transaction. All you need is a wallet, the Ethereum address you’d like to send funds to, and a little ETH for gas. </p>
<p><strong>All transactions require ETH for gas. We suggest having at least .01 ETH for 2 - 3 transactions. Read more about gas <a href="/en/transactions/what-is-gas/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>If you plan to move large amounts of ETH or ERC20 tokens, we suggest sending a small amount first to make sure everything goes as planned. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> <a href="/en/getting-started/how-to-access-your-wallet/">Access your wallet</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the button that says ‘Send Transaction’, or find this section in the ‘Send’ category from the left menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Fill in the type of currency you’d like to send, the amount, and the address you’d like to send to. </p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to double and triple check the address you’re sending to! We cannot recover funds sent to the wrong address.</li>
<li>When sending your entire balance of ETH, choose the ‘Send Entire Balance’ option, so your gas is auto-calculated out of the total. </li>
<li>Gas and gas limit will auto-generate based on network congestion.</li>
<li>If you don’t see the token you’d like to send, you may need to <a href="/en/tokens/how-to-add-custom-token/">add it as a custom token</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click ‘Send Transaction’ and confirm the transaction on the next screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re using MEWconnect or a hardware wallet, be sure to confirm the transaction on your device as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Your transaction has been posted! Copy your transaction hash, for your records. </p>
<ul>
<li>Check your transaction hash on <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a> to make sure everything went through properly. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Ethereum network requires gas to execute transactions. Ether (ETH) is the fuel used for this purpose. When you send tokens, interact with a contract, send ETH, or do anything else on the blockchain, you must pay for that computation. That payment is calculated in gas, and gas is always paid in ETH.</p>
<p>You are paying for the computation, regardless of whether your transaction succeeds or fails. Even if it fails, the miners must validate and execute your transaction, which takes computational power. You must pay for that computation, just like you would pay for a successful transaction.</p>
<p>You can see your transaction fee (gas limit * gas price) in ETH &amp; USD when you search for your transaction on Etherscan.io.</p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a fee that MyEtherWallet, or any other service provider, receives. This fee is paid to miners for mining transactions, validating them into blocks, and securing the blockchain.</p>

<p>Every Ethereum address has two versions to it, one that includes uppercase letters and one that doesn’t. These are called the checksummed and non-checksummed versions, respectively. Take for example, the MEW donation address:</p>
<p>Non-checksummed version: <code>0xdecaf9cd2367cdbb726e904cd6397edfcae6068d</code></p>
<p>Checksummed version: <code>0xDECAF9CD2367cdbb726E904cD6397eDFcAe6068D</code></p>
<p>These two addresses include all the same characters and lead to the same destination, the checksummed one is just a little more useful for determining the accuracy of the address. Both versions of the address are viable and usable, but the checksummed version is the preferred version to use. If even one character of an address is off, any tokens or coins sent to the wrong address will be lost forever. This is not something to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will receive an error warning you that your address is not checksummed, preventing or warning you from making a transaction or adding a custom token. This is for your own safety. Do not be alarmed, though! </p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Input the address you’re interested in viewing into the search field.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will be taken to a page for the address, with balances and a list of transactions</p>

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>The Ethereum blockchain is a network. Ether (ETH) is the fuel for that network. When you send tokens, interact with a contract, send ETH or ERC20 tokens, or do anything else on the blockchain, you must pay for that computation. That payment is calculated in gas, and gas is always paid in ETH.</p>
<p>You are paying for the computation, regardless of whether your transaction succeeds or fails. Even if it fails, the miners must validate and execute your transaction, which takes computational power. You must pay for that computation just like you would pay for a successful transaction.</p>
<p>You can see your transaction fee (gas limit * gas price) in ETH &amp; USD when you search for your transaction on Etherscan.io. This is not a fee that MyEtherWallet (MEW), or any other service provider, receives. This fee is paid to the remote miners for mining transactions, putting them into blocks, and securing the blockchain.</p>
<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a><strong>Overview</strong></h2><p>When you hear the term ‘gas’, the person speaking is either talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas Limit</li>
<li>Gas Price</li>
</ul>
<p>The total cost of a transaction (the “transaction fee”) is the Gas Limit * Gas Price.</p>
<p>You can think of the gas limit as the total amount of liters/gallons/units of gas a car can hold. </p>
<p>You can think of the gas price as the cost of that liter/gallon/unit of gas.</p>
<ul>
<li>With a car, it’s dollars (price) per gallon (unit).</li>
<li>With Ethereum, it’s GWEI (price) per gas (unit).</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s say you want to fill up your 10 gallon tank.<br>It would take 10 gallons of gas, at <code>$2.50</code> each. That total would come out to <code>$25</code>.</p>
<p>Likewise, fulfilling a gas limit of <code>21000</code> means filling <code>21000</code> units of gas.<br>If each unit is set at <code>20 GWEI</code>, your total would come out to <code>0.00042</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the total transaction fee in this scenario would be <code>0.00042 ETH</code>.</p>
<p>Sending tokens will typically take a bit more gas than sending ETH, so we generally recommend having 0.1 ETH for 2 - 3 token transactions.</p>
<p>You can use our tool to calculate GWEI &lt;-&gt; WEI &lt;-&gt; USD <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/convert-units" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, which can be helpful when you want to know your transaction fee in ETH, rather than GWEI.</p>
<h2 id="Gas-Limit"><a href="#Gas-Limit" class="headerlink" title="Gas Limit"></a><strong>Gas Limit</strong></h2><p>The gas limit is called the limit because it’s the maximum amount of units of gas you are willing to spend on a transaction. This avoids situations where there is an error somewhere in a contract, and you end up spending <code>1 ETH</code>, then <code>10 ETH</code>, and then <code>1000 ETH</code>, going in circles but arriving no where.</p>
<p>However, the units of gas necessary for a transaction are already defined by how much code is executed on the blockchain. If you do not want to spend as much on gas, lowering the gas limit won’t help much. You must include enough gas to cover the computational resources you use or your transaction will fail due to an ‘Out of Gas’ error.</p>
<p>All unused gas never leaves your wallet. So if you go to MyEtherWallet, send <code>1 ETH</code> to our donation address, and use a gas limit of <code>400000</code>, you will receive <code>400000 - 21000* = 379000</code> back. However, if you were sending <code>1 ETH</code> to a contract, and your transaction to the contract fails, you will use the entire <code>400000</code> and receive nothing back.</p>
<p><em>*<code>21000</code> is the standard gas limit for regular transactions.</em></p>
<h2 id="Gas-Price"><a href="#Gas-Price" class="headerlink" title="Gas Price"></a><strong>Gas Price</strong></h2><p>If you want to spend less on a transaction, you can do so by lowering the amount you pay per unit of gas. The price you pay for each unit increases or decreases how quickly your transaction will be mined.</p>

Does setting a low gas price mean it won’t ever be mined?"></a><strong>Will increasing the gas price get it mined faster? Does setting a low gas price mean it won’t ever be mined?</strong></h2><p>The transaction fees go to the miner who mines your block. When miners mine a block, they have to decide which transactions to include. They can choose to include no transactions, or they can choose to randomly select transactions. In order to encourage miners to include transactions in blocks you want to set a ‘gas price’ that is high enough to make them want to include it (since it is entirely up to them).</p>
<p><em>Most</em> miners follow a very simple strategy for inclusion. They include transactions they received sorted from highest gas price to lowest, then include them until either the block is full, or they reach one that has a gas price set lower than they are willing to bother with.</p>
<p>You want to set the gas price high enough so that a miner includes your transaction in a block. If you are in a hurry, you can set the gas price even higher, so that you jump ahead of everyone in line.</p>
<p>If you are not in a hurry, you just need to set a number high enough so that someone eventually includes your transaction.</p>
<h2 id="Why-should-I-set-a-low-gas-price"><a href="#Why-should-I-set-a-low-gas-price" class="headerlink" title="Why should I set a low gas price?"></a><strong>Why should I set a low gas price?</strong></h2><p>Because it’s cheaper, and because with the increasing price of ETH (compared to USD), a transaction that used to cost half a cent, may now cost a few cents. </p>
<p>More expensive transactions, like interacting with certain Dapps, can now cost a dollar or more! As a user, you should try sending non-urgent transactions with a lower gas price as the more transactions that occur at the lower gas price, the more likely miners will lower their minimums.</p>

<p>In Ethereum, every transaction has a nonce. The nonce is the number of transactions sent from a given address.</p>
<p>In English, a nonce is a number that can only be used once. In cryptography, a nonce is a one-time code selected in a random or pseudo-random manner that is used to securely transmit a main password, preventing replay attacks.</p>
<p>Each time you send a transaction, the nonce value increases by <code>1</code>. There are rules about what transactions are considered valid transactions, and the nonce is used to enforce some of these rules. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Transactions must be in order.</strong> You cannot have a transaction with a nonce of <code>1</code> mined before one with a nonce of <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No skipping!</strong> You cannot have a transaction with a nonce of <code>2</code> mined if you have not already sent transactions with a nonce of <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-does-it-matter"><a href="#Why-does-it-matter" class="headerlink" title="Why does it matter?"></a><strong>Why does it matter?</strong></h2><p>This value prevents double-spending, as the nonce will always specify the order of transactions. If a double-spend <em>does</em> occur, it’s typically due to the following process:</p>
<ul>
<li>A transaction is sent to one party.</li>
<li>They wait for it to register.</li>
<li>Something is collected from this first transaction.</li>
<li>Another transaction is quickly sent with a high gas price.</li>
<li>The second transaction is mined first, therefore invalidating the first transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why exchanges wait for you to have a certain number of confirmations before allowing you to trade freshly-deposited funds.</p>
<h2 id="When-using-the-Ethereum-blockchain-the-above-is-not-possible"><a href="#When-using-the-Ethereum-blockchain-the-above-is-not-possible" class="headerlink" title="When using the Ethereum blockchain, the above is not possible."></a><strong>When using the Ethereum blockchain, the above is not possible.</strong></h2><p>In Ethereum, this method of “double-spending” is not possible because each transaction has a nonce included with it. Even if you attempt to do the above, it will not work as the second transaction (nonce of <code>3</code>) cannot be mined before the first transaction (nonce of <code>2</code>).</p>
